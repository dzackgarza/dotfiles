Totally! I did software engineering in the Bay Area for a while, at a medium-sized corporation. The pay and job security are great, but the norm has shifted toward temporary/contract workers, so stability and benefits take a hit.

The majority of available work at these companies is in testing/debugging and maintenance of legacy codebases/systems though, which can be difficult, mind-numbing, and stressful at times (e.g. security issues due to old software)

There's also "inertia" in the sense that it's hard to touch or change anything that affects revenue, so hacky solutions tend to stick around long-term. So e.g. a person can work on adding a single new button to a website for months/years.



Totally! I did software engineering at a medium-sized corp in the Bay area for a while. The pay, culture, perks were all great, and I lucked into a neat project in computer graphics (which ends up being pretty Math-y).

These companies can be fun because they share some qualities of academia: a ton of smart/talented people to talk to, lots of organized activities, social events, lunches etc. And programming itself is puzzle-like and can be rewarding for those that like problem-solving.

I left that because the norm has shifted toward temp/contract work, and most of the work is in testing/debugging/maintaining legacy systems. There's also "inertia" at big companies, so it can take a person months to add a single button to an app/website if it affects revenue.
