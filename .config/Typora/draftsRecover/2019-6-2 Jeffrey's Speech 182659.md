## About the Occasion

Thank the organizers, very happy to have the opportunity to join you all and celebrate the end of the year. I'm glad to see that the club is continuing these kinds of events, and hope they do so in the future as well.



## About Myself

My name is Zack Garza, for those of you who don't personally know me, I graduated from UCSD last year (2018) with a major in Pure Mathematics, and was involved in SUMS during my last 2 years as an undergraduate. I'm starting a Ph.D. program in Mathematics in just a few weeks here on the East coast, so I'm honored to be here with you guys and to be able to attend one last SUMS event before I go!

I'm here today because I'd like to say a few words about Jeffrey Saikali. For anyone that doesn't know him, it is this gentleman sitting right over here. He is an Undergraduate and Graduate Advisor here at UCSD, as well as the Community Advisor for this club. The job description for academic advisor reads something like

```
To provide guidance to undergraduate students and other constituents on UCSD and department policies and procedures. Provide individuals with accurate information and appropriate referrals to various campus offices/resources. 
...
Knowledge of undergraduate academic regulations, policies, and requirements preferred. 
...
Competently advise students in order to ensure they meet these requirements. 

```

While the expectations of a Community Advisor read something like

```
Meet University expectations of advisors.
Attend committee meetings.
Provide a link between students and the University.
Interpret policy and take appropriate positions on delicate issues.
Be familiar with the politics and procedures of the organization and institution.

```

And what I'm here today to talk to you about is how Jeffrey not only meets but consistently exceeds these expectations. When things are going well, it becomes very easy to take peoples' contributions for granted, so I think it's important to really take time to notice and acknowledge the fact that it takes not just hard work and conscientious, active involvement, but a *consistence* in these over time. This is **work**, and it gives an organization a certain intangible quality that transforms it from some loose collection of people showing up to the same room into a cohesive group into an organization that has a heart, a share sense of purpose, and a cohesion and camaraderie that allows the organization to make a lasting impact. It's an integral part of any lasting organization, but in the hustle and bustle of club paperwork, finances, event logistics, and somehow working all of this around usual student life, it's not something one often stops to think about or appreciate. And yet, the club not be what it is without that work, so I think it's important to acknowledge Jeffrey's contributions in this regard. Of everyone in this room, he has by bar been involved with the club for the longest period of time, and without his efforts, we would most certainly not be sitting here today.

## Professional Involvement

Since not everyone was around at the club's inception, I'd like to recount a bit of the club's history and describe some of Jeffrey's involvement to the best of my knowledge.

- 2015 

  - I started in the Summer, I believe Jeffrey started this year as well
  - Math club existed, but most members graduated, so lapsed between Spring 2016 and Fall 2016
  - Not only unable to do the usual quick renewal process, but seemingly not enough of the original members left to carry it out.

- 2016

  - Jeffrey held a meeting near the beginning of Fall quarter, laying out the details of what needed to be done to start the club from scratch
    - For those of you who don't know him, Jeffrey Saikali is an Undergraduate/Graduate Advisor here at UCSD, and also the current Community Advisor for this club.
  - Done on his own accord, very early in the year, did much of the legwork of collecting information and describing it at length to students in attendance. Several principal members took on the role of getting the club registered through the university.
  - Around Spring, the club was registered and began having meetings, events, etc. I and other officers would often meet with Jeffrey to discuss how to structure the club, what kinds of policies to include in the constitution, how to get students and officers involved in events and logistics and settings things up, how to go about elections and outreach and voting and countless other details. These became the groundwork upon which nearly all of the club's current structure evolved.
  - *As an aside, this is the year we learned about Jeffrey's aversion to the Google corporation. We had a running joke about printing out a large Google banner to secretly hang in his office, but we didn't want to give the poor guy a heart attack!*

- 2017

  - Consistently involved, met with the club's leadership consistently and stressed the importance of communicating the club's activities regularly. I'd like to stress how excellent this is!! I've heard many tales of club advisors being extremely hands-off, having no interest in most events, the club's internal structure, policies, etc. Having an advisor that not only actively encourages regular meetings and open lines of communication BUT ALSO attends more than just a few "big" events per year is really quite rare.

    

## Personal Involvement

- Anecdote: knows more Math than you might expect!
  - Did his Bachelor’s and Master’s in Mechanical Engineering, specifically in rigid body dynamics. I recall one time we had a great conversation about how elements of the rotation group $SO(3, \mathbb R)​$ don’t commute -– demonstrated with a pencil.  
  - Also taught some Mathematics courses before coming to UCSD as an undergraduate counselor
- Numerous hiccups along the way as club was still finding its footing -- Jeffrey was always kind, dispassionate, devoted many hours to email correspondences and personal meetings to help resolve all issues that came up.
- Took active interest in the club -- attended many events, participated, talked with students, came to meetings and offered ideas and advice. Consistently constructive feedback, actively working to improve the club. Also helped solve "hard issues" in diplomatic ways.
  - I recall him helping with event logistics no less than a dozen times, if not far more. He has offered his office space to us on many occasions to cool and store drinks, helped pop popcorn for movies, helping to suggest movies/shows/activities, assisting with setup and cleanup at nearly every event he attended, and more.
  - I recall him attending a number of board game nights and actively getting involved - playing games, talking to students, etc. I specifically recall one where a number of members who knew each other were sitting at one table and a newcomer came in and sat alone, as they didn't know anyone, and Jeffrey going to join them. I joined them slightly later to find that they were talking about the student's life, major, different club activities
- Personal Note:
  - Was excellent as a personal and academic advisor while I was applying to graduate school. I’m the first in my immediate family to do anything remotely like graduate school, and I had numerous conversations with Jeffrey in my last year that helped inform me of what to expect and alleviate many fears and anxieties I had about applying.
  - Talked about the GRE, personal statements, his own experiences at UCLA. I learned a huge amount about the structure of a graduate program, which was totally alien to me. How funding worked, how coursework worked, different ideas for how to transfer coursework and how to approach recommendation letters, personal statements, transcripts, etc.
- Excellent mentor in professionalism and efficiency, for both myself and the club. 
  - If any of you have emailed Jeffrey at any point in your lives, you'll know that he is really quite particular about the format and content of his emails. Although this may seem a bit quirky, I have come to find out that his style is valuable!
  - Valuable skill in the "business world", not just because it helps you get a job. Actually valuable in your interactions with other people, particularly those who are maybe not as organized or professional. Some lessons:
    - Taking notes during important in-person information exchanges
    - Email etiquette, getting important things stated in writing, being meticulous enough in details to easy search at a later date, being direct in what you're asking people (specific questions, dates, etc)
  - Excellent language skills. Has a way of wording things very elegantly and succinctly. Immaculate grammar, punctuation, mastery of the English language -- from firsthand experience, this can be extremely uncommon, particularly with Science/Technology/Engineering fields! It really adds a level of professionalism and competency to all communications with this individual.
- Excellence as a counselor
  - Speaking from personal experience, this is one of the few people working within a large, bureaucratic university environment who will be inclined to get to know you personally and display actual interest in you and your goals. 
  - Strong moral compass, and dedication to doing what he feels is right (sometimes in spite of disinterested students, university faculty, etc)
- Key to the continuity of the club
  - In my time, consistently came to large quarterly meetings to help describe the club to new members, orient new participants, and help inform (and remind) them of the history, goals, and purpose of the organization.
- Expert. Knowledgeable.
