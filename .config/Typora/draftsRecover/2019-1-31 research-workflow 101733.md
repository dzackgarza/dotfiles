Last year, I did two quarters (or about 5 months) of undergraduate research, and the purpose of this post is to capture some of the techniques I developed. One thing that surprised me about research was the sheer amount of material you end up reading, including textbooks, expository notes, longer writeups or drafts of books, and of course papers and journal articles. I also ended up needing different sources at different levels of detail -- one textbook might have a number of chapters dedicated to what I'm trying to learn, while another may just have a section that is short but nevertheless covers an important result. Or an entire may not be directly related to what I'm doing, but offers an elegant proof or definition that is useful when writing up results.

Within Mathematics, we are lucky that LaTeX is very commonly used, so a great deal of relevant material can be found in PDFs.
