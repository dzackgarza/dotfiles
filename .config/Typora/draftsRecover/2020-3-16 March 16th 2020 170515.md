Cogroup objects: have structure maps
$$
m: H \to H^2 \\
e: H \to 0 \\
i: H \to H
$$
where $0$ is an initial object.

Example: $S^n \in \mathrm{hoTop}$.
Importance: What structure does $H$ need to have such that $\hom(H,\wait)$ has a group structure when applied? The answer is that $H$ is a group object in $\mathcal{C}\op$, or equivalently that $H$ is a cogroup object in $\mathcal{C}$.

The forgetful functor $U: \Set\to\Grp$ is representable by $\hom_{\Grp}(\ZZ, \wait)$, and the coproduct in $\Grp$ is the free product.

The adjoint to the forgetful functor $\mathrm{CommRing} \to \Set$ is the free commutative ring on $X$, i.e. $\ZZ[X]$.
