To whom it may concern,



I just wanted to reach out to express a final thanks for the Diana C. Miles scholarship that was extended to me as an undergraduate a few years ago. I worked part-time alongside my full-time classes, and this scholarship really made it easy and possible to be flexible with my work hours. 



I graduate with a degree in Mathematics in 2018, after which I went to work as a Data Scientist for about a year. I also applied to graduate programs, and accepted a PhD position at the University of Georgia in Athens where I will be doing research in an area called Topology. 



It also allowed me enough free time to practice my instruments -- although I'm still quite an amateur, I can now play drums and guitar rather well, as well as a few songs and scales on piano. As it turns out, Athens is a city with a lively local music scene
