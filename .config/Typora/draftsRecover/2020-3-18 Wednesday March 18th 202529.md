Representing cohomology:

Definition:
A spectrum $E$ **represents** a cohomology theory $h$ iff
$$
h^{\color{blue} n}(X) = \lim_{{\color{red}k}\to\infty} [ \Sigma^{{\color{red} k} - {\color{blue} n }} X, E_{\color{red} k} ]
$$
Theorem:
Any cohomology theory defined on the category of *compact* topological spaces can be extended to a cohomology theory on $\Top$.

To represent singular cohomology with coefficients in $G$, take the suspension spectrum of $K(G, 1)$, denoted $HG$; then $H^n(X; G) = [X, HG_n] = [X, K(G, n)]$.

Spectra have homotopy groups, e.g.
