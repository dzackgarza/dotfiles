## Computing Real Integrals Using Complex Analysis

- Goal: compute something like
  $$
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)~dx \text{ or just } \int_0^\infty f(x) ~dx
  $$

- Summary of approach:

  - Use the fact that $\R \hookrightarrow \C$ as the real line, so this is equivalent to a contour integral along $L_R = \{ x + 0i \mid -R \leq x \leq R\}$. So we’re equivalently computing this line integral: 
    $$
    \int_{L_R} f(z) ~dz
    $$
    

  - Note that we’ve implicitly identified the original $f: \R \to \R$ with a *new* $f: \C \to \C$ which is given by the same formula. It may be the case that the first $f$ was well-behaved, but the new $f$ has complex singularities - in fact, we are counting on it!

  - Line integrals aren’t much easier to compute, but complex integrals around *closed contours* are very easy. So pick a closed contour that includes $L_R$ - in this case, we’ll take half-circle of radius $R$ in the upper half plane, $C_R$:

  - We can then write
    $$
    \oint f(z) ~dz = \int_{L_R} f(z)~dz + \int_{C_R}f(z)~dz
    $$
