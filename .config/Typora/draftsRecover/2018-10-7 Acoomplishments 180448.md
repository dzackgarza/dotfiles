# Description

A detailed list of accomplishments that I believe Jeffrey may be able to speak about in a potential letter of recommendation. Some things that I did:



- Worked with the department and undergraduate students to reinstate the defunct undergraduate Mathematics Club.
  - Took the initiative to begin hosting independent math-related talks and workshops in the club's absence (e.g. fliers near beginning of Fall 2017 advertising lightning talks)
  - Organized and plan meetings with the general student body to find out what they wanted from a Math club
  - Organized and planned meetings with 4-6 principal members to establish the club officially within the university
- Wrote constitution and created an election process to assemble a team of 10+ officers, led as president for 1.5 years
- Brought several student issues to the faculty's attention:
  - Shortage of study spaces within Math dept. building 
  - Desire for extra research-level colloquium course hosted by Math professors
- Orchestrated at least several dozen Math-related events over the course of two years, including
  - Talks and colloquia for undergraduate on a number of mathematical topics
    - Note: I began by giving many of these talks myself, and we later expanded to include other undergraduate and graduate students
  - Showing math-related movies, along with corresponding talks about the mathematicians depicted and their work.
    - Note: I often researched and gave these talks myself, we also invited a graduate student for one
  - A number of technical workshops
    - E.g. various programming languages, Latex
  - Social events aimed at bringing together math students
    - E.g. board game nights, quarter-end socials
  - Note: secured university funding for a majority of these events, which required navigating a great number of university-wide policies
  - Note: also strove to have most events be intellectually stimulating and directly related to Math, as opposed to purely social
- Learned to balance the time commitments of the club with my own academic work 
  - First 0.5 years: held independent events while starting advanced graduate coursework
  - Remaining 1.5 years: continued advanced graduate coursework while officially serving as president
  - Time commitments of club: >10 hours per week
    - Chaired weekly meetings to organize officers' work, plan events, secure funding
    - Weekly events, personally hosted/organized/carried out logistics for many
- Designed, assembled content, and served as judge for annual integration competition (twice)
- Worked with department annually (twice) to design and distribute Mathematics graduation stoles to graduating seniors
- Worked as liaison between students/officers and department and university faculty, represented the club in a positive and professional light.
- Worked passionately to get both students and officers *actively* involved and establish an organization that values and demonstrates honesty, transparency, and integrity in how they conduct themselves and  club operations
  - Active involvement: designed projects and tasks that required officer to work together and solicit feedback from one another  (e.g. the website design), also had all officers discuss their own accomplishments and progress weekly and quarterly at meetings
  - Honesty: worked to keep officers honest with funding requests and tracking of finances (e.g. Aiden in late 2017, and implementing tracking of petty cash and finances with Yuqi in 2017-2018)
  - Transparency: worked to ensure constitution and all meeting minutes + decisions available online, consistently invited students to all business and planning meetings and specifically elicited their feedback (e.g. early combined advisor/business meetings in Fall 2017)



Perhaps Jeffrey can also speak to my coursework a bit:

- Took a relatively challenging series of undergraduate courses as first year transfer (100 and 140 series)
- Begin taking graduate-level courses in second year (200A, 241A/B in Fall 2016/Winter 2017, 247A in Spring 2017, 290 series throughout 2017-2018 academic year)
- Note: slightly worse grades in 2017 when I began to take on club commitments. Difficult to balance at times (notably Fall 2016 and Fall 2017), but improved as time went on.
  - Fall 2016: spent time trying to get early club principal members to meet, hosted a number of independent events myself to fill Math club void while club registration process was pushed through. 
    - Also began working part-time, about 16-20 hours per week. Continued this job for the remainder of my time as a student.
  - Fall 2017: Had early principal members leave and an entire group of new officers and principal members to help. Had to take on the work of securing rooms and funding for events, also had to teach new officers how to navigate these processes.

And possibly some character qualities?

- Passionate about mathematics
- Willing to invest time and work to help improve the department and to help Math students
- Organized/detailed
- Knowledgeable about areas of mathematical interest
  - E.g. Jeffrey attended at least one of the lightning talks I gave, on a topic called Homology I believe
- Conduct myself professionally when leading discussions/meetings
  - E.g. from our specific advisor meetings, or Fall 2017 combined weekly meetings, or other events I've hosted
  - Also from email communications perhaps
