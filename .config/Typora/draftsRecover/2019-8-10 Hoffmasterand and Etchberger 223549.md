Zack Garza is a first-year graduate student in Mathematics at the University of Georgia. Zack began his education at a junior college in California, worked as a software developer and a data scientist for several years, and then transferred to the University of California, San Diego to complete his undergraduate degree in Mathematics.

Zack's primary research is in Topology, a branch of Mathematics that studies different types of "spaces", the ways they can be continuously deformed, and how they can be classified and distinguished from one another. He was drawn to the University of Georgia due to the large number of faculty members in the Topology research group who work in and around this area, who are as kind and welcoming as they are knowledgeable, as well as the many other faculty members in other research groups working on equally interesting problems.

Zack has been involved in Mathematics in many ways over the years, including creating and presiding over an undergraduate Mathematics club, organizing student seminars and colloquia, as well as giving a number of talks and hosting technical workshops. He began his research by taking a number of graduate courses as an undergraduat
