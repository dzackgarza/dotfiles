feat: implement comprehensive block state transition logic with validation and recovery

Task 11.4 Complete - Block State Transition Logic Implementation:

CORE IMPLEMENTATION:
‚Ä¢ Created block_state_transitions.py with comprehensive transition management
‚Ä¢ Pre-inscription validation with multiple condition checks (content, tokens, sub-blocks, processing, metadata, operations)
‚Ä¢ Error recovery strategies for failed transitions with automatic retry
‚Ä¢ Thread-safe operation tracking with context managers
‚Ä¢ Visual feedback integration with real-time status updates

ENHANCED TIMELINE INTEGRATION:
‚Ä¢ Modified unified_timeline.py to use new transition manager for safe inscription
‚Ä¢ Added validation methods for checking inscription readiness
‚Ä¢ Support for force flag to bypass validation when needed
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive error handling with ValidationError, InscriptionError, RecoveryError

VISUAL FEEDBACK SYSTEM:
‚Ä¢ Enhanced live_block_widget.py with real-time transition status messages
‚Ä¢ Display transition duration, attempt counts, and error states
‚Ä¢ Update CSS classes based on active transitions from transition manager
‚Ä¢ Clear visual indicators for live (‚óè), transitioning (‚ßó), and inscribed (‚óâ) states

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:
‚Ä¢ Created test_block_state_transitions.py with unit tests for all components
‚Ä¢ Created test_state_transition_user_story.py with user story demonstrations
‚Ä¢ TDD validation with temporal grid proof showing 12-step Sacred GUI validation
‚Ä¢ Fixed path resolution in task_story_bridge.py for correct test execution

TDD VALIDATION PROOF:
‚úÖ User story generated for Task 11.4 with Sacred GUI acceptance criteria
‚úÖ Temporal grid created showing 4x3 grid with 12-step validation process
‚úÖ Canonical pilot test passed confirming real functionality
‚úÖ Task completed and marked as 'done' with full TDD validation

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
- Validation conditions: content completeness, token finalization, sub-block readiness, processing completion, metadata validity, no active operations
- Recovery strategies: automatic cleanup of simulations, progress completion, token validation fixes
- Error handling: detailed error messages with context and troubleshooting guidance
- Visual feedback: real-time transition status, error indicators, duration tracking
- Thread safety: context managers, locks, atomic operations for concurrent access

The block state transition system now provides robust, user-friendly transitions
from live to inscribed states with comprehensive error handling, visual feedback,
and validation. Handles edge cases like interrupted processing, network failures,
and partial completions gracefully while maintaining data consistency.
