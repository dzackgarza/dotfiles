# Frontend and UI for Mathematics-Focused Hobby Projects

## Mathematics-First UI Design
- **ALL UIs MUST HANDLE MATHJAX OUTPUT WELL** - assume mathematical content everywhere
- Use frameworks that integrate well with MathJax/KaTeX rendering
- Test mathematical notation rendering in all UI components
- **MATHEMATICAL CONTENT IS PRIMARY** - design around equations, formulas, symbols

## Use Established Themes and Color Schemes Only
- **WE DO NOT CHOOSE COLOR SCHEMES OURSELVES, EVER**
- Import palettes from well-known libraries or use their defaults
- Use popular, well-known, out-of-the-box themes exclusively
- Examples: Material Design colors, Bootstrap themes, Tailwind default palette
- **NEVER CREATE CUSTOM COLORS** - use predefined design systems

## Use Out-of-the-Box UI Frameworks
- **WE DO NOT MAKE AESTHETIC DECISIONS OURSELVES**
- Use modern frameworks and libraries that handle styling by default
- **FRAMEWORKS SHOULD MAKE THINGS LOOK GOOD AUTOMATICALLY**
- Don't create custom CSS or design systems for hobby projects
- Examples: Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design

## Mathematical Content Integration
- Ensure framework supports MathJax/KaTeX without conflicts
- Use frameworks with good typography for mathematical symbols
- Test equation rendering in cards, modals, tables, and lists
- **CRASH if mathematical content doesn't render properly**

## Framework Selection for Mathematics
- Does it work well with MathJax out of the box?
- Does it have good typography defaults for mathematical content?
- Are there established themes available?
- Does it handle responsive mathematical notation?
- **CHOOSE FRAMEWORKS THAT SUPPORT MATHEMATICAL RENDERING**

## Mathematical Libraries Integration
- **MathJax** - comprehensive LaTeX rendering
- **KaTeX** - fast mathematical notation rendering
- **Plotly** - interactive mathematical plots and graphs
- **D3.js** - custom mathematical visualizations
- Use frameworks that integrate well with these libraries
