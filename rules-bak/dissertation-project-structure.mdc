# Dissertation Project Structure

## Main Content Areas
- **[writing/sections/](mdc:writing/sections/)** - All dissertation content organized by chapter
  - **[writing/sections/1_chapter/](mdc:writing/sections/1_chapter/)** - Chapter 1: Lattice theory fundamentals (32 files)
  - **[writing/sections/2_chapter/](mdc:writing/sections/2_chapter/)** - Chapter 2: Compactifications and moduli spaces (14 files)

## Development Environment
- **[diss-setup](mdc:diss-setup)** - Canonical environment setup script (ALWAYS source this first)
- **[dev/scripts/](mdc:dev/scripts/)** - All project tooling and utilities
- **[dev/tex/](mdc:dev/tex/)** - LaTeX packages, templates, and configuration

## Key Infrastructure Files
- **[STYLE.md](mdc:STYLE.md)** - Comprehensive style guide for mathematical notation and LaTeX formatting
- **[.git/hooks/pre-commit](mdc:.git/hooks/pre-commit)** - Enforces compilation validation before commits
- **[audits/README.md](mdc:audits/README.md)** - Quality assurance and audit framework

## CLI Tools
Use `diss` command after sourcing environment:
- `diss validate single [file]` - Test individual file compilation
- `diss validate` - Check all files
- `diss build` - Full document compilation
- `diss report` - Generate comprehensive project status

## Critical: Always Run Environment Setup
```bash
source diss-setup
```
This loads all paths, tools, and canonical configurations.
