# Workflow for Hobby Projects

## Simple Build Process
- Keep build steps minimal and obvious
- Use make or simple shell scripts
- Don't build complex build systems for hobby projects
- **CRASH if build steps fail**

## Basic Logging
- Log what's happening during build/deploy
- Use simple print statements for build progress
- Don't build elaborate logging systems
- **Make it obvious when something goes wrong**

## Manual Deployment
- Keep deployment simple and manual for hobby projects
- Don't automate deployment until you need to
- Use simple scripts that you can run manually
- **Let the user handle infrastructure manually**

## Maintenance
- Keep maintenance commands simple
- Provide basic cleanup scripts if needed
- Don't build complex maintenance systems
- **Focus on getting things working, not maintaining forever**
