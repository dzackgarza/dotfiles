# Writing Project Style Guide Architecture

## Multi-Guide System for Complex Writing Projects

For substantial writing projects (academic papers, technical documentation, books), use a **specialized style guide architecture** rather than a single monolithic style document.

### Recommended Structure

**1. Main Style Index** - [STYLE.md](mdc:STYLE.md)
- Entry point for all style guidelines
- Quick reference for different use cases (writing vs review vs collaboration)
- Cross-references to specialized guides

**2. Technical Formatting Guide** - Focus on markup, syntax, formatting rules
- Markdown/LaTeX syntax standards
- Cross-reference formatting and citation styles
- Version control formatting practices (clean diffs)
- Build system integration

**3. Content-Specific Style Guide** - Domain-specific conventions
- Notation systems (mathematical, scientific, technical)
- Terminology standards and preferred vocabulary
- Content organization principles
- Proof/argument structure guidelines

**4. Verification/Quality Guide** - Computational verification and quality assurance
- Fact-checking procedures
- Automated validation patterns
- Citation verification
- Content integrity workflows

### Benefits of Specialized Guides

✅ **Targeted Audience**: Writers vs reviewers vs technical collaborators can focus on relevant sections
✅ **Maintainability**: Easier to update domain-specific vs technical formatting rules separately
✅ **Onboarding**: New contributors can focus on relevant guide for their role
✅ **Scalability**: Can add new specialized guides without restructuring existing ones

### Implementation Principles

- **Cross-reference actively** between guides to avoid duplication
- **Maintain single source of truth** for each type of guideline
- **Version together** but allow independent updates to specialized sections
- **Test compliance** systematically across all guide types

Use this architecture for any writing project with multiple contributors, technical requirements, or complex notation systems.
