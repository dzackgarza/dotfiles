## Recent Progress (2025-07-12)

### Turn Separator Spacing Fix ✅
Successfully fixed the excessive vertical spacing issue with turn separators:
- Changed margin from `1 0` to `0 0` in CSS
- Added explicit `max-height: 1` and `padding: 0 0`
- Set `styles.height = 1` and `styles.max_height = 1` in widget initialization
- Added `get_content_height()` method returning 1 to ensure Textual respects the height

The turn separator now correctly takes up only 1 line instead of nearly a full screen.

## Next Priority Steps

### 1. Implement Missing Core Widgets (CRITICAL)
The Sacred GUI architecture requires two key widgets that are currently missing:

#### SacredTimelineWidget
- Copy V3's `VerticalScroll` pattern from `/V3/elia_chat/widgets/chat.py:95-108`
- Implement the `chat_container` property pattern
- Add dynamic mounting for blocks and separators
- Ensure thread-safe updates using `call_from_thread()`

#### LiveWorkspaceWidget  
- Use V3's streaming pattern with `@work(thread=True)`
- Implement sub-module display (Route Query → Research → Generate)
- Add auto-scroll logic from V3 (`chat.py:225-230`)
- Handle workspace show/hide transitions

### 2. Fix Turn Completion Transfer Logic
Currently, content stays in Live Workspace and doesn't transfer to Sacred Timeline:
- Implement V3's message system (`@dataclass` + `@on()` handlers)
- Add batch transfer using `mount_all()` when turn completes
- Clear Live Workspace after transfer
- Ensure hrule separator is added between turns

### 3. Implement Cognition Sub-Module Streaming
The Live Workspace should show real-time cognition steps:
- Route Query block appears first
- Research Steps stream in as they happen
- Assistant Response generates with typewriter effect
- Each sub-module should have distinct styling

### 4. Add Workspace Collapse Animation
- Workspace should smoothly collapse when turn completes
- Use CSS transitions for height changes
- Maintain 2-way split when idle, 3-way when processing

### 5. Test & Polish
- Verify scroll behavior matches V3 patterns
- Ensure no layout conflicts or spacing issues
- Test with multiple turns and long content
- Validate error handling doesn't break layout

## Key Implementation References

### V3 Patterns to Copy
1. **VerticalScroll Setup**: `/V3/elia_chat/widgets/chat.py:95-108`
2. **Dynamic Mounting**: `/V3/elia_chat/widgets/chat.py:143, 205, 337`
3. **Thread-Safe Updates**: `/V3/elia_chat/widgets/chat.py:205, 219-230`
4. **Message System**: `/V3/elia_chat/widgets/chat.py:71-90`
5. **Auto-Scroll Logic**: `/V3/elia_chat/widgets/chat.py:225-230`

### Sacred GUI Principles
- Three distinct areas: Timeline (top), Workspace (middle), Input (bottom)
- No nested containers in scroll areas
- Turn rhythm: User → Cognition → Assistant
- Workspace only visible during processing
- All history preserved in Sacred Timeline

## Current State Summary
- ✅ Three-area layout structure in place
- ✅ Turn separators now properly sized (1 line)
- ✅ Basic routing and error handling works
- ❌ Missing widget implementations (SacredTimelineWidget, LiveWorkspaceWidget)
- ❌ No turn completion transfer logic
- ❌ No cognition streaming display
- ❌ No workspace animations

The architecture is sound but needs the core widget implementations to function properly.
