Custom theme picker for instant theme switching

This replaces Textual's default theme provider with one that:
1. Shows themes with emoji icons in the command palette
2. Applies themes immediately when selected (no need to press Enter)
3. Shows theme descriptions as help text
4. Provides user-friendly notifications

Usage: Press Ctrl+P and type theme names to see and switch themes instantly.

# Note: Instant theme switching works because pressing Enter on a command
# immediately executes the theme switch. For true "live preview" on arrow
# key navigation, we'd need Textual's CommandPalette selection events
# (see GitHub issue #4595), which aren't available yet.
#
# Current behavior:
# - Ctrl+P opens command palette
# - Type theme name (e.g., "dracula", "tokyo", "nord")
# - Use arrow keys to navigate
# - Press Enter to instantly apply the selected theme
#
# This is much faster than the default theme picker!
