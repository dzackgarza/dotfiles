# V3-minimal justfile - delegates to parent project justfile

# Import all commands from parent justfile but adjust paths
# This allows hooks to work from the V3-minimal directory

# Core test command (what hooks expect)
test:
	cd .. && just test

# Quick test for development
test-core:
	pdm run pytest tests/test_core_functionality.py -v

# Quick lint for development
lint:
	pdm run black src/ tests/
	pdm run ruff check --fix src/ tests/
	pdm run mypy src/

# Run the app
run:
	pdm run python -m src.main

# Install dependencies

	pdm install
