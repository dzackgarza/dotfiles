Test file: $file

You must document ACTUAL observable behavior before writing tests.

Add to your test file:
\`\`\`python
# REALITY: Screenshot taken at [timestamp]
# - User types "hello" â†’ Shows "hello" with no formatting
# - No borders or titles visible
# - Turn separator appears BEFORE user message
# - Cognition block shows raw text "Processed through cognition pipeline"
# - Large whitespace gaps between elements
\`\`\`

Or update $REALITY_CHECK_FILE with current screenshot observations.

This prevents fantasy testing by anchoring tests to observed reality.
