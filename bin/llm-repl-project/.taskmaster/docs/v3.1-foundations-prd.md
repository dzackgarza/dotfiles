# Sacred GUI V3.1: Critical Architectural Foundations

This PRD defines the 36 critical architectural foundation tasks for V3.1, integrating the detailed ledger specifications with Task Master workflow management.

## Overview

V3.1 establishes the core Sacred Timeline architecture with robust context management, proving the viability of the transparent AI interaction model while solving fundamental LLM limitations.

## Core Requirements

### Phase 1A: Core UI & Timeline Architecture

#### Sacred Timeline Deep Dive
Implement the foundational Sacred Timeline with live vs inscribed block states. This includes:
- Live block staging area for transient state management
- Wall time tracking and token usage monitoring
- Transition mechanisms from live to inscribed states
- Complete data transparency for all operations

#### Memory and Context Management  
Solve the LLM context window limitation problem through:
- Dynamic context pruning with recency and relevance filtering
- Real-time token counting for both input and output
- Intelligent context formatting and presentation to LLMs
- Automated summarization of older conversation turns

#### Streaming Live Output System
Enable real-time transparency through:
- Live data streaming for all block types during processing
- Wall time, token usage, and intermediate response display
- Smooth animation of blocks transitioning from live to inscribed
- Integration with the Sacred Timeline for seamless updates

#### Event-Driven Communication
Establish decoupled plugin-UI communication via:
- Async event system for live updates from plugins
- Timeline manager integration without direct coupling
- Responsive UI updates for smooth user experience
- Plugin isolation with clean communication boundaries

#### Plugin System Foundation
Create extensible plugin architecture with:
- Support for plugin nesting (especially Cognition submodules)
- Data aggregation from nested plugins to parent blocks
- External validation for trusted plugin ecosystems

#### Intelligent Router System
Implement core cognition routing through:
- User intent analysis and routing to appropriate plugins
- Multiple LLM provider support and optimization
- Plugin extensibility and composability demonstration
- Dynamic routing based on context and capabilities

#### Rich Content Display Engine
Support diverse content types including:
- Flawless Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- LaTeX mathematics display (MathJax/KaTeX integration)
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks for multiple languages
- Interactive deep linking for filesystem and web content

### Phase 1B: Testing & Integration Infrastructure

#### Testing Framework
Comprehensive testing for:
- Live to inscribed block transition validation
- Context pruning and token management verification
- Dynamic element rendering and animation testing
- Plugin integration and validation testing

#### LLM Routing and Cognitive Plugins
Core cognition pipeline implementation:

- Cognitive plugin orchestration and management
- Multi-step reasoning process visualization
- Integration with the Cognition block display

#### Intelligent Context Pruning
Specific context management strategies:
- Relevance scoring algorithms for conversation history
- Automatic context window management
- User-configurable pruning preferences
- Performance optimization for large conversations

#### Turn Summarization System
Conversation length management through:
- Automated summarization of older turns
- Context-preserving compression techniques
- Integration with context pruning system
- Maintain conversation coherence across summaries

### Phase 1C: Core System Integration

#### Sacred Timeline Persistence
Complete conversation history management:
- Full timeline preservation with efficient storage
- Session restoration and continuity
- Subset selection for active LLM context
- Cross-session conversation threading

#### Graceful Rate Limit Handling
Robust LLM provider integration:
- Automatic rate limit detection and handling
- Provider failover and backup strategies
- Request queuing and retry mechanisms
- User notification of service limitations

#### Long-Running Work Ledger
Extended operation support:
- Cross-session task persistence
- Long-running operation progress tracking
- Integration with timeline for operation visualization
- Recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations

#### Manual Context Re-injection
User control over LLM context:
- Selective conversation history re-injection
- Manual context prioritization controls
- Summary and full-detail toggle options
- User-driven context management interface

### Phase 1D: Advanced Features & Polish

#### Core UI/UX Principles
Consistent interface guidelines:
- Sacred Timeline visual consistency
- Interaction pattern standardization
- Accessibility and usability standards
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

#### Input System Stability
Reliable user input handling:
- Multiline input support with formatting
- Copy-paste data handling and integration
- Input validation and error prevention
- History and completion capabilities

#### Command System Infrastructure
Extensible command processing:
- Plugin-based command registration
- Command validation and execution
- Auto-completion and help system
- Error handling and user feedback

#### Safety and Robustness
Error handling and recovery:
- Comprehensive error boundary system
- Graceful degradation for component failures
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- User-friendly error reporting and resolution

## Implementation Strategy

### Task Master Integration
- All 36 features will be added as separate tasks with proper dependencies
- Each task includes specific implementation details from the original ledgers
- Version-based tagging (v3.1) for easy filtering and management
- Research mode enabled for complex architectural decisions

### Dependency Management
- Phase 1A tasks build on the existing 10 foundation tasks
- Phase 1B depends on Phase 1A completion
- Phase 1C integrates completed foundations
- Phase 1D adds polish and advanced capabilities

### Natural Language Workflow
- "Show me the next V3.1 foundation task to work on"
- "Break down the Plugin System task with focus on MCP integration"
- "Research current best practices for LLM context management"
- "Update all V3.1 tasks based on our Textual implementation learnings"

## Success Criteria

### Technical Milestones
- Sacred Timeline with live/inscribed blocks fully operational
- Context management solving the "conversation too long" problem
- Plugin system supporting MCP and nested architectures
- Streaming system providing complete transparency

### User Experience Goals
- Every AI operation visible in real-time
- Sub-second response to user interactions
- Seamless plugin installation and validation
- Intuitive context management and control

This V3.1 foundation provides the architectural basis for all future Sacred GUI development, establishing the transparent, extensible, and intelligent interaction model that defines the project's core vision.
