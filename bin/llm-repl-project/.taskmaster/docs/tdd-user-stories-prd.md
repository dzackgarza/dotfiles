# Test-Driven Development with User Stories Integration

This PRD defines how to enforce test-driven development (TDD) with user stories throughout the Task Master workflow, ensuring every feature is validated through real user interaction scenarios.

## Overview

Integrate the existing Sacred GUI user story framework with Task Master's task management system to enforce TDD practices. Each task will require user stories that validate functionality through visual proof of user interaction flows.

## Current User Story Framework

The project already has a sophisticated user story testing system:
- **12-step interaction flows** captured as 4x3 temporal grids
- **Visual proof** through SVG screenshot sequences 
- **Complete user journeys** from launch to ready-for-next-interaction
- **Structured testing** with UserStory and UserStoryStep classes

## Integration Requirements

### Task Master Enhancement for TDD

#### User Story Requirements in Tasks
Every task must include:
- **User Story Definition**: Clear user interaction scenario being validated
- **Story Steps**: 12-step interaction flow that proves functionality
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific visual/behavioral outcomes expected
- **Test-First Development**: Story must be written BEFORE implementation
- **Story Validation**: Temporal grid proof that story passes

#### Enhanced Task Structure
Extend task metadata to include:
```json
{
  "userStory": {
    "storyId": "task_5_conversation_flow",
    "title": "User starts first conversation successfully", 
    "description": "New user types message, sees cognition, gets response",
    "acceptanceCriteria": [
      "User input appears in timeline with correct styling",
      "Cognition block appears and shows processing animation", 
      "Assistant response appears with proper formatting",
      "Timeline scrolls to show complete conversation",
      "Input field is ready for next interaction"
    ],
    "temporalGridPath": "debug_screenshots/task_5_temporal_grid.png"
  },
  "testStrategy": "Create user story first, verify it fails, implement feature, verify story passes with complete visual flow"
}
```

### TDD Workflow Integration

#### Pre-Implementation Phase
For every task, BEFORE coding:
1. **Write User Story**: Define the complete 12-step user interaction
2. **Create Story Test**: Add story to `tests/user_stories.py`
3. **Run Failing Test**: Verify story fails or shows incomplete behavior
4. **Document Expected State**: Capture what temporal grid should show when complete

#### Implementation Phase  
During development:
1. **Implement Incrementally**: Build feature to satisfy user story steps
2. **Run Story Regularly**: Check temporal grid progression
3. **Focus on User Experience**: Ensure story flow feels natural
4. **Visual Validation**: Each step should show expected UI state

#### Completion Phase
Before marking task complete:
1. **Story Must Pass**: Full 12-step temporal grid with smooth transitions
2. **Visual Inspection**: Grid shows proper Sacred GUI behavior
3. **Performance Check**: Story completes within reasonable timeframes
4. **User Experience Validation**: Flow feels natural and responsive

### Task Master Command Extensions

#### New TDD Commands
```bash
# Generate user story template for task
task-master generate-story --id=5 --prompt="User starts conversation"

# Run user story for specific task  
task-master test-story --id=5

# Update task with story results
task-master update-story --id=5 --grid-path="debug_screenshots/task_5_grid.png"

# Validate task completion with story proof
task-master validate-task --id=5 --require-story
```

#### Enhanced Status Workflow
```bash
# Cannot set to done without story proof
task-master set-status --id=5 --status=done
# Should check: "Task 5 requires user story validation. Run 'task-master test-story --id=5' first."

# Story-driven completion
task-master complete-with-story --id=5 --story-id="task_5_conversation_flow"
```

### Story-Driven Task Expansion

#### Subtask Generation with Stories
When expanding complex tasks:
```bash
task-master expand --id=5 --with-stories --research
```

This should generate subtasks where each subtask represents one user story validation:
- **5.1**: "User story: App launches and shows empty timeline"
- **5.2**: "User story: User types first message successfully"  
- **5.3**: "User story: Cognition processing displays correctly"
- **5.4**: "User story: Assistant response appears properly"

#### Research-Enhanced Story Creation
```bash
task-master expand --id=5 --with-stories --research --prompt="Focus on accessibility and error cases"
```

Should research current UX best practices and generate stories covering:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error recovery flows
- Accessibility requirements
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

### Integration with Existing Testing

#### Connect to Current Framework
- **Leverage existing** `tests/user_stories.py` structure
- **Extend UserStory class** with Task Master metadata
- **Integrate with** temporal grid generation system
- **Use existing** screenshot and validation infrastructure

#### Enhanced Story Validation
```python
@dataclass
class TaskMasterUserStory(UserStory):
    """User story linked to Task Master task"""
    task_id: str
    task_title: str
    completion_required: bool = True
    story_status: str = "pending"  # pending, passing, failing
    last_run: datetime = None
    grid_path: str = None
```

### Quality Gates and Enforcement

#### Task Completion Gates
Before task can be marked "done":
1. **Story Exists**: Task must have associated user story
2. **Story Passes**: Temporal grid shows complete successful flow
3. **Visual Quality**: Grid demonstrates proper Sacred GUI behavior
4. **Performance**: Story completes within acceptable timeframes

#### Development Workflow Integration
```bash
# Standard TDD cycle integrated with Task Master
task-master next                           # Get next task
task-master generate-story --id=X          # Create user story first
task-master test-story --id=X              # Verify story fails
# ... implement feature ...
task-master test-story --id=X              # Verify story passes
task-master complete-with-story --id=X     # Mark complete with story proof
```

#### Continuous Integration
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Verify tasks have required user stories
- **CI pipeline**: Run all task-associated stories on every commit
- **Story regression**: Detect when previously passing stories start failing
- **Quality metrics**: Track story pass rates and temporal grid quality

### Benefits

#### Enforced User Focus
- Every feature validated through actual user interaction
- No implementation without clear user story
- Visual proof of functionality working end-to-end
- Natural prevention of over-engineering

#### Quality Assurance
- Complete user flows tested, not just unit functionality
- Visual regression detection through temporal grids
- Performance validation through story timing
- User experience validation through story smoothness

#### Development Velocity
- Clear definition of "done" through story validation
- Reduced debugging through user-focused testing
- Better requirement understanding through story creation
- Faster onboarding through story documentation

#### Sacred GUI Alignment
- Stories validate Sacred Timeline behavior specifically
- User interactions prove the three-area layout works
- Visual evidence that transparency goals are met
- Confirmation that user experience matches architectural vision

This TDD integration ensures every Task Master task delivers real user value validated through visual proof of interaction success.
