# Sacred GUI Code Simplification & Architectural Review

This PRD defines tasks for periodic code review, complexity reduction, and architectural restructuring to maintain the simplicity and elegance of V3 while enabling necessary advanced features.

## Problem Statement

The project is drifting toward over-engineered solutions and accumulated cruft from incremental development. We need systematic review and refactoring to:
- Reduce unnecessary complexity introduced since V3
- Eliminate poor monkey-patching and technical debt
- Restructure modules into logical, separated concerns
- Maintain architectural clarity and simplicity

## Core Principles

### Simplicity First
- Every abstraction must justify its existence
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Eliminate intermediate layers that don't add clear value
- Keep the core Sacred Timeline concept pristine and simple

### Modular Architecture
- True separation of concerns between modules
- Clear, well-defined interfaces between components
- Logical directory structure reflecting functional boundaries
- No circular dependencies or tight coupling

### Code Quality Standards
- Maintainable, readable code over clever solutions
- Consistent patterns and conventions throughout
- Minimal API surface area for each module
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions

## Required Tasks

### Phase 1: Assessment and Analysis

#### Holistic Code Complexity Review
Comprehensive analysis of current codebase complexity:
- Identify over-engineered components and unnecessary abstractions
- Map current module dependencies and coupling points
- Analyze code metrics (cyclomatic complexity, depth, coupling)
- Compare current architecture against V3 simplicity baseline
- Document complexity hotspots and architectural drift areas

#### Module Boundary Analysis
High-level architectural review and restructuring plan:
- Evaluate current module organization and separation of concerns
- Identify modules that should be split or consolidated
- Design proper subdirectory structure reflecting functional boundaries
- Map ideal dependency graph with minimal coupling
- Create migration plan for module restructuring

#### Technical Debt Assessment
Systematic identification and prioritization of technical debt:
- Catalog monkey-patches, workarounds, and temporary solutions
- Identify code duplication and inconsistent patterns
- Document unused or deprecated code paths
- Assess test coverage gaps and testing complexity
- Prioritize debt by impact on maintainability and development velocity

### Phase 2: Strategic Refactoring

#### Core Timeline Simplification
Simplify the Sacred Timeline implementation:
- Eliminate unnecessary abstractions in timeline management
- Consolidate overlapping block state management
- Simplify the live vs inscribed block lifecycle
- Remove intermediate layers that don't add clear value
- Ensure the core concept remains clean and understandable

#### Plugin System Rationalization
Streamline the plugin architecture:
- Simplify plugin registration and discovery mechanisms
- Eliminate over-engineered plugin validation layers
- Consolidate plugin communication patterns
- Reduce plugin API surface area to essential functionality
- Clear separation between core plugins and extensions

#### Configuration System Cleanup
Simplify configuration management:
- Consolidate multiple configuration approaches into one clear system
- Eliminate configuration complexity that doesn't serve users
- Simplify hot-reload and validation mechanisms
- Reduce configuration file complexity and nesting
- Clear defaults that work out of the box

### Phase 3: Modular Restructuring

#### Directory Structure Reorganization
Implement logical module organization:
- Create clear subdirectories for major functional areas
- Separate core timeline logic from UI rendering concerns
- Isolate plugin system from core application logic
- Organize utilities and shared code appropriately
- Establish clear import patterns and module boundaries

#### Interface Simplification
Design minimal, clear interfaces between modules:
- Define essential APIs for each major component
- Eliminate unnecessary method overloads and options
- Create clear contracts between timeline, UI, and plugin systems
- Simplify event communication patterns
- Reduce the number of ways to accomplish the same task

#### Dependency Graph Optimization
Optimize module dependencies for clarity:
- Eliminate circular dependencies completely
- Reduce the number of dependencies each module requires
- Create clear dependency hierarchy with minimal coupling
- Isolate external dependencies to specific modules
- Enable independent testing and development of modules

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance

#### Simplified Testing Strategy
Streamline testing approach:
- Eliminate complex test setup and mocking requirements
- Focus on essential behavior testing over implementation details
- Simplify test data and scenarios
- Reduce test execution time and complexity
- Clear separation between unit, integration, and system tests

#### Documentation and Guidelines
Establish clear development guidelines:
- Document architectural principles and design decisions
- Create clear guidelines for adding new functionality
- Establish code review criteria focused on simplicity
- Document module responsibilities and boundaries
- Create examples of preferred patterns and anti-patterns

#### Continuous Complexity Monitoring
Implement ongoing complexity management:
- Establish metrics and thresholds for acceptable complexity
- Create automated checks for architectural violations
- Regular review cycles for new code additions
- Clear escalation path when complexity increases
- Integration with development workflow to prevent complexity drift

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Improvements
- 30-50% reduction in cyclomatic complexity metrics
- Elimination of circular dependencies
- Reduction in total lines of code while maintaining functionality
- Improved test execution speed and clarity
- Faster onboarding time for new developers

### Architectural Clarity
- Clear, logical directory structure reflecting functional boundaries
- Minimal, well-defined interfaces between major components
- Simplified plugin system with clear extension points
- Streamlined configuration with sensible defaults
- Maintainable Sacred Timeline core that preserves the V3 elegance

### Development Velocity
- Faster feature implementation due to clearer architecture
- Reduced debugging time from simpler code paths
- Easier refactoring due to better separation of concerns
- More reliable testing due to simplified dependencies
- Clear guidelines that prevent complexity re-introduction

This systematic approach ensures the Sacred GUI maintains its conceptual elegance while enabling necessary advanced features through principled, simple design rather than accumulated complexity.
