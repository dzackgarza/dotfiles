# Description: Implement the `task-master complete-with-story` command to mark tasks as complete with story proof.
# Details:
1.  Create a new command `complete-with-story` in the Task Master CLI.
2.  Implement the command logic to mark the task as complete with the specified story ID.
3.  Update the task status to 'done' and store the story ID in the task metadata.

# Test Strategy:
Run the `task-master complete-with-story` command with different task IDs and story IDs. Verify that the tasks are marked as complete and that the story IDs are stored correctly in the task metadata.
