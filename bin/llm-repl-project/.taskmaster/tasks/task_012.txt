# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Context Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement dynamic context pruning with recency and relevance filtering, real-time token counting, intelligent context formatting, and automated summarization.
# Details:
1. Implement recency and relevance scoring algorithms. 2. Implement token counting for input and output. 3. Develop context formatting logic. 4. Integrate summarization of older conversation turns.

# Test Strategy:
Verify context pruning effectiveness, token count accuracy, and summarization quality. Test with various conversation lengths.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Recency and Relevance Scoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement algorithms to score context turns based on recency and relevance to the current query. User story: As a user, I want the system to prioritize recent and relevant information in the context window to improve response accuracy.
### Details:
Develop and test scoring functions that consider both the age of a context turn and its semantic similarity to the current user input. Ensure the scoring is efficient and scalable.

## 2. Implement Token Counting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement real-time token counting for both input and output text. User story: As a developer, I need accurate token counts to manage context window size and avoid exceeding API limits.
### Details:
Integrate a token counting library (e.g., tiktoken) to accurately measure the number of tokens in user inputs, system outputs, and context turns. Implement caching to improve performance.

## 3. Develop Context Formatting Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop logic to format the context window for optimal model performance. User story: As a user, I want the system to present context in a clear and structured format to improve response quality.
### Details:
Design a context formatting strategy that includes separators, prefixes, and other formatting elements to help the model understand the relationships between different context turns. Experiment with different formats to optimize performance.

## 4. Implement Summarization of Older Conversation Turns [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Implement automated summarization of older conversation turns to reduce context window size. User story: As a user, I want the system to retain key information from past conversations without exceeding token limits.
### Details:
Integrate a summarization model to automatically generate concise summaries of older context turns. Implement a mechanism to decide when to summarize based on token count and relevance scores.

## 5. Integrate with the Timeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Integrate the context management system with the existing timeline to preserve conversation history. User story: As a user, I want the system to seamlessly integrate with the timeline to maintain a consistent and complete record of my interactions.
### Details:
Modify the context management system to store and retrieve context turns from the timeline. Ensure that the timeline is updated whenever the context window changes.

## 6. Optimize Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Optimize the performance of the context management system to ensure real-time responsiveness. User story: As a user, I want the system to respond quickly even with a large context window.
### Details:
Profile the context management system to identify performance bottlenecks. Implement caching, parallelization, and other optimization techniques to improve response time.
