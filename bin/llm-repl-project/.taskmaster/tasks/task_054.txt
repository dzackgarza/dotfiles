# Task ID: 54
# Title: Implement Sub-Module Visual Redesign with Block Widgets
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a visual redesign of sub-modules, converting existing floating text elements into block-style widgets with clear boundaries. Integrate the existing timer and token counter functionalities into these new block widgets, focusing on visual styling and presentation to improve clarity and user experience.
# Details:
1. Convert existing floating text elements used for sub-modules into distinct block-style widgets.
2. Design and implement clear visual boundaries and styling for each sub-module block.
3. Integrate the existing timer display functionality (from Task 11.3) into the new sub-module block widgets, ensuring correct positioning and styling within the block.
4. Integrate the existing token counter display functionality (from Task 11.3) into the new sub-module block widgets, implementing or styling token counter animations as required by the design.
5. Ensure the new block widget design is responsive and adapts correctly to different screen sizes.
6. Refactor relevant existing code to integrate seamlessly with the new block widget UI components.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all sub-modules are rendered as distinct block widgets with clear visual boundaries and styling.
2. Verify that the integrated timer displays are visible within their respective blocks and continue to display time accurately.
3. Verify that the integrated token counter displays are visible within their respective blocks and that token counter animations (if applicable) are smooth and visually informative.
4. Test the sub-module block UI on various screen sizes and orientations to ensure responsiveness.
5. Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the clarity, usability, and overall visual appeal of the new block widget design.
