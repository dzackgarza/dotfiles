# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create Error Boundary System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an error boundary system for graceful failure handling. This ensures that errors in one part of the application do not crash the entire application.
# Details:
1. Implement error boundaries for each UI section (Timeline, Workspace, Input).
2. Implement a mechanism to catch and log errors.
3. Implement a mechanism to display error messages to the user.

# Test Strategy:
Introduce errors in different parts of the application. Verify that the errors are caught and logged correctly. Ensure that the application does not crash and that error messages are displayed to the user.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Error Boundaries for UI Sections [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create error boundary components for the Timeline, Workspace, and Input sections using Textual's error handling capabilities. Wrap each section with an error boundary to isolate potential errors.
### Details:
Utilize Textual's widget system to create reusable error boundary components. Implement specific error handling logic within each boundary to manage errors gracefully.

## 2. Implement Error Catching and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a centralized error catching mechanism using try-except blocks and a logging system to record error details. Integrate with Textual's event system to capture unhandled exceptions.
### Details:
Use Python's `logging` module to record error messages, stack traces, and relevant context information. Configure the logging system to write to a file and/or console. Implement exception handling within the error boundaries to catch and log errors.

## 3. Implement User-Friendly Error Messages [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Design and implement a system for displaying user-friendly error messages within the UI. These messages should be informative but not expose sensitive technical details.
### Details:
Create a dedicated UI element (e.g., a modal dialog or a status bar message) to display error messages. Use a standardized format for error messages, including a brief description of the error and potential solutions. Ensure that the messages are localized and accessible.

## 4. Implement Error Recovery Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Implement strategies for recovering from errors, such as retrying failed operations or gracefully degrading functionality. Consider using Textual's reactive properties to manage component state after an error.
### Details:
Implement retry mechanisms for network requests or other potentially failing operations. Implement fallback mechanisms to disable or replace components that have encountered errors. Use Textual's reactive properties to update the UI based on the error state.

## 5. Test Error Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create a suite of tests to simulate various error scenarios, including network failures, invalid input, and unexpected exceptions. Verify that the error boundaries, logging system, and user error messages are working correctly.
### Details:
Use `pytest` to create unit and integration tests for the error handling system. Mock external dependencies to simulate error conditions. Verify that errors are caught, logged, and displayed to the user correctly. Ensure that the application does not crash and that the UI remains responsive.
