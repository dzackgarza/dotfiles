# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 36, 37, 38, 41
# Priority: low
# Description: Streamline the testing approach by eliminating complex test setup, focusing on essential behavior testing, and simplifying test data.
# Details:
1. Eliminate complex test setup and mocking requirements.
2. Focus on essential behavior testing over implementation details.
3. Simplify test data and scenarios.
4. Reduce test execution time and complexity.
5. Ensure clear separation between unit, integration, and system tests by refactoring the testing framework.

# Test Strategy:
Evaluate the streamlined testing approach by measuring the test execution time and complexity. Ensure that the essential behavior is covered by the tests and that the test setup is simplified.
