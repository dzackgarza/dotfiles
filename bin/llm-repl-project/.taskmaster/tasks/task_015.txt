# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Plugin System Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an extensible plugin architecture with support for plugin nesting, data aggregation, external validation, and MCP server integration.
# Details:
1. Implement plugin architecture. 2. Support plugin nesting. 3. Implement data aggregation. 4. Implement external validation. 5. Integrate with MCP server.

# Test Strategy:
Verify plugin loading, nesting, data aggregation, and MCP integration. Test with various plugins.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Plugin Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core plugin architecture, including plugin loading, unloading, and management. Focus on extensibility and testability.
### Details:
Define plugin interfaces, implement plugin discovery mechanisms, and create a plugin manager.

## 2. Support Plugin Nesting [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Implement the ability for plugins to contain and manage other plugins, creating a hierarchical plugin structure.
### Details:
Modify the plugin architecture to allow plugins to register child plugins and manage their lifecycle.

## 3. Implement Data Aggregation Across Plugins [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Develop a mechanism for plugins to share and aggregate data, enabling cross-plugin communication and collaboration.
### Details:
Define a data sharing protocol and implement data aggregation functions within the plugin architecture.

## 4. Implement External Validation Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Integrate with external validation systems to allow plugins to validate data and operations against external rules and constraints.
### Details:
Define an interface for external validation and implement adapters for specific validation systems.

## 5. Integrate with MCP Server [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.3
### Description: Establish communication and data exchange between the plugin architecture and the MCP server.
### Details:
Implement an API client for the MCP server and integrate it into the plugin architecture.

## 6. Manage Plugin Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Implement a system for managing plugin dependencies, ensuring that plugins have access to the required resources and libraries.
### Details:
Develop a dependency resolution mechanism and integrate it into the plugin loading process.
