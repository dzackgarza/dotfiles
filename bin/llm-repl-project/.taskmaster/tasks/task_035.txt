# Task ID: 35
# Title: Technical Debt Assessment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Systematically identify and prioritize technical debt within the codebase, including monkey-patches, code duplication, and testing gaps.
# Details:
1. Catalog monkey-patches, workarounds, and temporary solutions.
2. Identify code duplication and inconsistent patterns.
3. Document unused or deprecated code paths.
4. Assess test coverage gaps and testing complexity.
5. Prioritize debt by impact on maintainability and development velocity, creating a prioritized list of technical debt items.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the completeness of the technical debt assessment by cross-referencing the identified items with code reviews and developer feedback. Ensure the prioritization aligns with the project's maintainability and development velocity goals.
