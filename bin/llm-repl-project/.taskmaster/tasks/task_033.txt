# Task ID: 33
# Title: Holistic Code Complexity Review
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the current codebase to identify areas of over-engineering, unnecessary abstractions, and architectural drift.
# Details:
1. Utilize code analysis tools to measure cyclomatic complexity, coupling, and depth of inheritance.
2. Manually review code to identify over-engineered components and unnecessary abstractions.
3. Map module dependencies and coupling points to visualize the current architecture.
4. Compare the current architecture against the V3 simplicity baseline to identify areas of drift.
5. Document complexity hotspots and architectural drift areas in a report.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the accuracy of the complexity analysis by cross-referencing the identified hotspots with manual code reviews. Ensure the documented areas of drift align with the project's architectural goals.
