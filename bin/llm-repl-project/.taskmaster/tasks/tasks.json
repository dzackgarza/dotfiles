Delivered SimpleSimilarityCalculator, ContextScorer, and AdvancedContextScorer components. Implemented features include recency scoring with exponential decay (24hr half-life), semantic relevance using keyword overlap and frequency weighting, combined scoring with configurable weights (30% recency, 70% relevance), optimal context selection within token limits, conversation boundary detection and Q&A pair bonuses, and human-readable scoring explanations. Comprehensive testing was performed on programming help conversations, long conversations with intelligent context pruning, token limit enforcement with optimal selection, and recency vs relevance trade-offs.
