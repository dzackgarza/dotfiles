# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `task-master generate-story` command to generate user story templates for tasks.
# Details:
1.  Create a new command `generate-story` in the Task Master CLI.
2.  Implement the command logic to generate a user story template based on the task ID and prompt.
3.  The template should include fields for story ID, title, description, acceptance criteria, and temporal grid path.
4.  Store the generated template in a predefined location (e.g., `tests/user_stories.py`).

# Test Strategy:
Run the `task-master generate-story` command with different task IDs and prompts. Verify that the generated user story templates are created correctly and contain the expected fields.
