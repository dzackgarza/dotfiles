# Task ID: 36
# Title: Core Timeline Simplification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35
# Priority: medium
# Description: Simplify the core Sacred Timeline implementation by eliminating unnecessary abstractions, consolidating block state management, and removing intermediate layers.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current Sacred Timeline implementation to identify unnecessary abstractions.
2. Consolidate overlapping block state management logic.
3. Simplify the live vs inscribed block lifecycle.
4. Remove intermediate layers that don't add clear value.
5. Ensure the core concept remains clean and understandable by refactoring the code to reduce complexity.

# Test Strategy:
Test the simplified Sacred Timeline implementation by creating unit tests that cover the core functionality. Verify that the simplified implementation maintains the same behavior as the original implementation.
