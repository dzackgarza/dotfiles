# Status: done

# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `task-master validate-task` command to validate task completion with story proof.
# Details:
1.  Create a new command `validate-task` in the Task Master CLI.
2.  Implement the command logic to validate task completion based on the user story and temporal grid.
3.  Check if the task has an associated user story and if the temporal grid shows a complete successful flow.
4.  Verify that the visual quality and performance of the story are acceptable.

# Test Strategy:
Run the `task-master validate-task` command with different task IDs. Verify that the task completion is validated correctly based on the user story and temporal grid.
