# Task ID: 56
# Title: Develop User Stories and Canonical Tests for Sequential AI Processing Display
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 10, 53
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create user stories and canonical tests for the sequential AI processing display, ensuring the user experience is well-defined and validated with sub-second precision.
# Details:
1.  Develop user stories that capture the expected behavior of the sequential AI processing display, including the step-by-step appearance of sub-modules, animated token counts, and timers.  These stories should cover scenarios such as initial loading, processing states, completion states, and error handling.
2.  Write canonical tests to validate the sequential processing experience. These tests should use screenshot comparisons with sub-second precision to ensure that the animations, timers, and sub-module displays are rendered correctly at specific points in time.
3.  Incorporate tests for different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure responsiveness.
4.  Include tests for edge cases, such as very short or very long processing times, and error conditions.
5.  Document the user stories and tests in a clear and organized manner, linking them to the relevant code modules.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Execute the canonical tests and verify that all screenshot comparisons pass with the specified precision.
2.  Manually review the user stories to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior of the sequential AI processing display.
3.  Perform manual testing of the UI to ensure that the animations, timers, and sub-module displays are visually appealing and informative.
4.  Test the application on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
5.  Introduce artificial delays and errors to test the handling of edge cases and error conditions.
