USER STORY: As a user, I want to see rich content beautifully rendered in the timeline so I can engage with diverse information types naturally. When I receive Markdown formatted text, it should render with proper headers, lists, and emphasis. Mathematical equations should display with professional LaTeX rendering. Code blocks should have syntax highlighting that makes them easy to read. Links should be interactive and clearly distinguished. The rendering should feel native to the application, not like embedded web content.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Markdown rendering, LaTeX display, syntax highlighting, and deep linking functionality. Test with various content types.
