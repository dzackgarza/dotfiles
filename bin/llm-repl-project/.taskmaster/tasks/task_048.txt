# Task ID: 48
# Title: Implement 'test-story' Command
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 46, 47
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the `task-master test-story` command to run user stories for specific tasks and generate temporal grids.
# Details:
1.  Create a new command `test-story` in the Task Master CLI.
2.  Implement the command logic to run the user story associated with the specified task ID.
3.  Integrate with the existing Sacred GUI user story framework to execute the user story and generate a temporal grid.
4.  Store the generated temporal grid in the specified location (e.g., `debug_screenshots/task_X_grid.png`).

# Test Strategy:
Run the `task-master test-story` command with different task IDs. Verify that the user stories are executed correctly and that the temporal grids are generated and stored in the specified locations.
