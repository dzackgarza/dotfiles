# Task ID: 51
# Title: Enhance 'set-status' Command with Story Validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 50
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the `task-master set-status` command to prevent marking tasks as 'done' without story proof.
# Details:
1.  Modify the `set-status` command in the Task Master CLI.
2.  Add a check to verify if the task requires user story validation before setting the status to 'done'.
3.  If the task requires validation, display an error message and prevent the status change.

# Test Strategy:
Run the `task-master set-status` command with different task IDs and statuses. Verify that the status cannot be set to 'done' without story proof for tasks that require validation.
