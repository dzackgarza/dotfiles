# Task ID: 39
# Title: Directory Structure Reorganization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 34, 36, 37, 38
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a logical module organization by creating clear subdirectories for major functional areas and establishing clear import patterns.
# Details:
1. Create clear subdirectories for major functional areas (e.g., core timeline logic, UI rendering, plugin system).
2. Separate core timeline logic from UI rendering concerns.
3. Isolate plugin system from core application logic.
4. Organize utilities and shared code appropriately.
5. Establish clear import patterns and module boundaries by moving files and updating import statements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the new directory structure by manually inspecting the file organization and import statements. Ensure that the module boundaries are clear and that the import patterns are consistent.
