# Title: Fix Scrolling Glitches in Live Workspace
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 53, 54
# Priority: medium
# Description: Address scrolling glitches in the live workspace to ensure smooth and seamless user experience during sub-module processing. The scrolling should be fluid and responsive, allowing users to easily follow the AI's thinking process without visual interruptions.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current scrolling implementation in the Live Workspace to identify the root cause of the glitches.
2. Implement a debouncing or throttling mechanism to limit the frequency of scroll updates, preventing excessive rendering.
3. Optimize the rendering of `SubModuleWidget` to improve performance during scrolling.
4. Investigate and resolve any layout issues that may be causing the glitches when new sub-modules appear.
5. Implement virtual scrolling or similar techniques to render only the visible portion of the workspace, reducing the rendering overhead.
6. Ensure that the scrolling behavior is consistent across different browsers and devices.
7. Profile the scrolling performance using browser developer tools to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
8. Consider using CSS transitions or animations to smooth out the scrolling experience.

# Test Strategy:
1. Manually test the scrolling behavior in the Live Workspace with various sub-module configurations.
2. Verify that the scrolling is smooth and glitch-free, even when new sub-modules appear and process.
3. Test the scrolling performance on different browsers and devices to ensure consistency.
4. Use browser developer tools to measure the frame rate and identify any performance issues during scrolling.
5. Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the scrolling experience and identify any remaining issues.
6. Test with different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure the scrolling remains smooth and responsive.
7. Verify that the scrolling behavior is consistent with the expected user experience.
