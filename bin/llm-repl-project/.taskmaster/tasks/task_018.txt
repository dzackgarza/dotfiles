# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing for block transition validation, context pruning verification, dynamic element rendering, and plugin integration.
# Details:
1. Implement unit tests for block transitions. 2. Implement integration tests for context pruning. 3. Implement UI tests for dynamic rendering. 4. Implement end-to-end tests for plugin integration.

# Test Strategy:
Run all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Verify code coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Unit Tests for Block Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement unit tests to validate individual block transitions. User Story: As a developer, I want to ensure each block transition functions correctly in isolation, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues with individual transitions.
### Details:
Write unit tests for each block transition function, covering various input scenarios and expected outputs. Use a mocking framework to isolate the block transition logic.

## 2. Implement Integration Tests for Context Pruning [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Implement integration tests to verify context pruning functionality. User Story: As a tester, I want to verify that context pruning correctly removes irrelevant information while preserving essential context, so that the system remains efficient and accurate.
### Details:
Create integration tests that simulate real-world scenarios with varying conversation lengths and complexities. Verify that the context pruning algorithm correctly identifies and removes irrelevant information.

## 3. Implement UI Tests for Dynamic Rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Implement UI tests to ensure dynamic rendering of elements. User Story: As a user, I want to see elements dynamically rendered on the UI correctly and responsively, so that I have a smooth and intuitive user experience.
### Details:
Use a UI testing framework to automate UI interactions and verify that elements are rendered correctly based on different data inputs and user actions. Test responsiveness across different screen sizes.

## 4. Implement End-to-End Tests for Plugin Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Implement end-to-end tests to validate plugin integration. User Story: As a system administrator, I want to ensure that plugins integrate seamlessly with the core system, so that I can extend functionality without compromising stability.
### Details:
Create end-to-end tests that simulate user workflows involving plugin interactions. Verify that data flows correctly between the core system and plugins, and that plugins function as expected.

## 5. Automate Code Coverage Measurement [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.4
### Description: Automate the process of measuring code coverage. User Story: As a QA engineer, I want to automatically measure code coverage during test execution, so that I can identify areas of the codebase that are not adequately tested.
### Details:
Integrate a code coverage tool into the build process. Configure the tool to generate code coverage reports after each test run. Set up thresholds for minimum acceptable code coverage.

## 6. Automate Test Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.5
### Description: Automate the execution of all tests (unit, integration, UI, and end-to-end). User Story: As a DevOps engineer, I want to automate the execution of all tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
### Details:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically trigger test execution upon code commits. Configure the pipeline to run all tests and report results. Integrate with a notification system to alert developers of test failures.
