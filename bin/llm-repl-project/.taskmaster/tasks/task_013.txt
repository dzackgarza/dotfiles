# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Streaming Live Output
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable real-time transparency through live data streaming for all block types, wall time, token usage, and intermediate response display, and smooth animation of blocks transitioning from live to inscribed.
# Details:
1. Implement live data streaming for blocks. 2. Display wall time, token usage, and intermediate responses. 3. Animate block transitions. 4. Integrate with Sacred Timeline for updates.

# Test Strategy:
Verify live data streaming, display accuracy, and animation smoothness. Test integration with the Sacred Timeline.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Live Data Streaming Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the backend infrastructure to stream live data for blocks, including wall time, token usage, and intermediate responses. Focus on testable components.
### Details:
Establish a streaming pipeline using appropriate technologies (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events) to transmit real-time data from the backend to the frontend. Ensure the pipeline is robust and scalable.

## 2. Display Real-Time Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop the UI components to display wall time, token usage, and intermediate responses in real-time. Provide clear visual feedback.
### Details:
Create UI elements to display the streamed data. Implement mechanisms to update these elements dynamically as new data arrives. Ensure the display is user-friendly and informative.

## 3. Animate Block Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Implement smooth animations for blocks transitioning from live to inscribed states. Focus on visual appeal and performance.
### Details:
Design and implement animations that visually represent the transition of blocks from a live, actively streaming state to an inscribed, finalized state. Optimize animations for smooth performance.

## 4. Integrate with Sacred Timeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Integrate the live data streaming and block transitions with the Sacred Timeline for updates and synchronization.
### Details:
Ensure that the Sacred Timeline is updated in real-time with the latest data from the live stream and that block transitions are reflected accurately on the timeline. Implement mechanisms to synchronize the live data with the timeline's state.

## 5. Handle Streaming Errors Gracefully [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage streaming errors and provide informative feedback to the user.
### Details:
Implement error detection and handling mechanisms to catch and manage potential errors during the streaming process. Provide informative error messages to the user and implement fallback strategies to maintain a stable user experience.
