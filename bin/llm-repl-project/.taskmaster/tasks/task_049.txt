# Description: Implement the `task-master update-story` command to update tasks with story results and temporal grid paths.
# Details:
1.  Create a new command `update-story` in the Task Master CLI.
2.  Implement the command logic to update the task with the story results and the path to the temporal grid.
3.  Update the `userStory` field in the Task data structure with the new information.
