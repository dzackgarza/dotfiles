# Task ID: 28
# Title: Unify Timeline Ownership and Block Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish a single source of truth for block management, clear ownership model, atomic state transitions, and proper state machine for the block lifecycle.
# Details:
1.  Identify the existing LiveBlock/Timeline conflicts.
2.  Design a clear ownership model for block management.
3.  Implement atomic state transitions to preserve block relationships.
4.  Implement a state machine for the complete block lifecycle.
5.  Use locks or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions and ownership conflicts.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Unit tests to verify the state machine transitions.
2.  Integration tests to ensure that block relationships are preserved during state transitions.
3.  Concurrency tests to verify that race conditions are eliminated.
