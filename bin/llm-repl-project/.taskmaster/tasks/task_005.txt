# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Basic Conversation Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the basic User -> Cognition -> Assistant conversation flow. This includes handling user input, processing it through a mock cognition pipeline, and displaying the assistant's response.
# Details:
1. Implement an event handler in the `PromptInput` widget to capture user input.
2. Create a mock cognition pipeline that simulates AI processing.
3. Implement a function to generate a mock assistant response.
4. Add the user input, cognition output, and assistant response to the Sacred Timeline using `SimpleBlockWidget`.

TDD REQUIREMENT: This task requires a user story showing complete conversation flow from user input to assistant response. Must demonstrate: 1) User types message, 2) Cognition processing appears, 3) Assistant response displays, 4) Timeline updates properly. Generate temporal grid proof before completion.

# Test Strategy:
Enter a message in the `PromptInput` widget. Verify that the user input, cognition output, and assistant response are displayed correctly in the Sacred Timeline. Ensure that the conversation flow is smooth and responsive.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Capture User Input in PromptInput Widget [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement an event handler in the `PromptInput` widget to capture user input.
### Details:
Implement an event listener (e.g., onKeyPress, onChange) to capture text entered by the user in the `PromptInput` widget. Store the captured input for subsequent processing.

## 2. Create Mock Cognition Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a mock cognition pipeline that simulates AI processing.
### Details:
Develop a mock function or class that takes the user input as input and returns a simulated cognition output. This could involve simple keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, or any other mock AI processing step. The output should be structured data.

## 3. Generate Mock Assistant Response [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Implement a function to generate a mock assistant response based on the cognition output.
### Details:
Implement a function that takes the output from the mock cognition pipeline and generates a text-based response that simulates an assistant's reply. This could involve simple string concatenation or more complex template-based generation.

## 4. Add Elements to Sacred Timeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Add the user input, cognition output, and assistant response to the Sacred Timeline using `SimpleBlockWidget`.
### Details:
Use the `SimpleBlockWidget` to display the user input, the output from the mock cognition pipeline, and the generated assistant response in the Sacred Timeline. Ensure that the data is formatted clearly and visually distinct.

## 5. Integrate Widgets [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.4
### Description: Integrate all widgets to ensure seamless conversation flow.
### Details:
Connect the `PromptInput` widget, the mock cognition pipeline, the assistant response generator, and the `SimpleBlockWidget` in the Sacred Timeline to create a complete conversation flow. Ensure that data is passed correctly between components.

## 6. Implement TDD User Story Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Write TDD user story validation to demonstrate complete conversation flow.
### Details:
Write a user story that describes the complete conversation flow from user input to assistant response. Implement automated tests to validate that the user story is fulfilled. The tests should verify that the user input, cognition output, and assistant response are displayed correctly in the Sacred Timeline.
