# Task ID: 41
# Title: Dependency Graph Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 39, 40
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize module dependencies for clarity by eliminating circular dependencies, reducing the number of dependencies each module requires, and isolating external dependencies.
# Details:
1. Eliminate circular dependencies completely.
2. Reduce the number of dependencies each module requires.
3. Create clear dependency hierarchy with minimal coupling.
4. Isolate external dependencies to specific modules.
5. Enable independent testing and development of modules by refactoring the module dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the optimized module dependencies by analyzing the dependency graph and ensuring that there are no circular dependencies. Ensure that the number of dependencies each module requires is minimized and that external dependencies are isolated.
