# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project with PDM
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with PDM, setting up the virtual environment and basic project structure.
# Details:
1. Create a new directory for the project.
2. Run `pdm init` to initialize the project.
3. Configure `pyproject.toml` with project metadata (name, version, description, authors, license).
4. Specify Python version.
5. Add `textual`, `pytest`, `rich`, `pydantic`, and `httpx` as initial dependencies using `pdm add`.
6. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude virtual environment and other temporary files.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the virtual environment is created correctly and that the dependencies are installed. Check the `pyproject.toml` file to ensure the configuration is correct.
