# Task ID: 34
# Title: Module Boundary Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct a high-level architectural review to evaluate the current module organization and separation of concerns, and create a restructuring plan.
# Details:
1. Evaluate the current module organization and separation of concerns.
2. Identify modules that should be split or consolidated based on their functionality.
3. Design a proper subdirectory structure that reflects functional boundaries.
4. Map an ideal dependency graph with minimal coupling between modules.
5. Create a migration plan for module restructuring, outlining the steps required to move modules to the new structure.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the restructuring plan by simulating the module migration and verifying that all dependencies are correctly resolved. Ensure the new directory structure aligns with the project's functional boundaries.
