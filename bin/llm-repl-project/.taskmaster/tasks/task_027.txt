# Task ID: 27
# Title: Remove Unused Code and Dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Remove the unused InputProcessor, consolidate demo files, clean up dead imports, and reduce codebase size.
# Details:
1.  Delete the InputProcessor class and all its references.
2.  Consolidate the 7 demo files into 3 canonical examples.
3.  Use a code analysis tool (e.g., pylint, flake8) to identify and remove dead imports and unused dependencies.
4.  Refactor code to eliminate conflicting code paths and redundant implementations.
5.  Measure codebase size before and after cleanup to ensure a 15-20% reduction.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Manual testing to ensure that the removal of InputProcessor does not break any existing functionality.
2.  Verify that the consolidated demo files cover all the necessary use cases.
3.  Code review to ensure that all dead imports and unused dependencies have been removed.
