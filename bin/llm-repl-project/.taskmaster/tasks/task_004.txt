USER STORY: As a user, I want a responsive input area where I can type both short and long messages with confidence, knowing the system will guide me with smart validation and handle multiline content properly. The input should feel natural - expanding for longer content, providing helpful feedback for invalid input, and making it clear when I can submit. I should be able to use standard keyboard shortcuts and have a predictable way to submit my message.

# Test Strategy:
Test multiline input by entering multiple lines of text. Verify that the input is validated correctly. Ensure that the input is submitted correctly when the user presses Enter.
