# Task ID: 53
# Title: Implement Sequential Sub-Module Display with Animated Token Counts and Timers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 29
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refine the sequential processing display. Sub-modules should appear one at a time, and their associated wall time timers (already functional) and animated token counts should start only when that specific sub-module begins processing, stopping when it completes. This creates the core Sacred Timeline user experience.
# Details:
1. Modify the UI rendering logic to display sub-modules sequentially, ensuring only one is 'active' or visible at a time during its processing phase.
2. Integrate with the processing flow to trigger the start of a sub-module's wall time timer (from Task 11.3) precisely when that sub-module begins processing.
3. Implement animation for the token counts for the currently active sub-module, animating from 0/0 to the final X/Y values during its processing.
4. Stop the wall time timer and freeze the display of the sub-module's final state (timer value, token counts) when its processing completes.
5. Ensure smooth transitions and sequencing between the completion of one sub-module and the start of the next.
6. Integrate animation timing with the AnimationClock system for consistent visual updates.
7. Consider using CSS animations or JavaScript animation libraries for the animated token counts.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that sub-modules appear and become active one at a time in the correct sequence.
2. Confirm that each sub-module's wall time timer starts only when that specific sub-module begins processing.
3. Confirm that each sub-module's wall time timer stops precisely when that sub-module completes processing.
4. Check that the token counts animate correctly from 0/0 to the final values for the active sub-module.
5. Ensure that the display (timer, token counts) freezes correctly when a sub-module completes.
6. Test with different numbers of sub-modules and varying processing times to ensure correct sequential behavior.
7. Verify consistent animation timing and sequential display across different browsers and devices.
