# Task ID: 40
# Title: Interface Simplification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 36, 37, 39
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design minimal, clear interfaces between modules by defining essential APIs for each major component and simplifying event communication patterns.
# Details:
1. Define essential APIs for each major component (e.g., timeline, UI, plugin system).
2. Eliminate unnecessary method overloads and options.
3. Create clear contracts between timeline, UI, and plugin systems.
4. Simplify event communication patterns.
5. Reduce the number of ways to accomplish the same task by refactoring the module interfaces.

# Test Strategy:
Test the simplified interfaces by creating integration tests that verify the communication between modules. Ensure that the essential APIs are sufficient for the required functionality and that the event communication patterns are clear.
