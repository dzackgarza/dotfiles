# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Intelligent Router System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement core cognition routing through user intent analysis, multiple LLM provider support, plugin extensibility, and dynamic routing based on context and capabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement user intent analysis. 2. Support multiple LLM providers. 3. Enable plugin extensibility. 4. Implement dynamic routing logic.

# Test Strategy:
Verify intent analysis accuracy, LLM provider switching, and dynamic routing effectiveness. Test with various user inputs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement User Intent Analysis Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and implement algorithms to analyze user input and determine the user's intent for routing purposes. Focus on testable routing decisions based on intent.
### Details:
Design and implement algorithms for intent recognition, including natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Ensure the algorithms can accurately classify user intent for routing.

## 2. Support Multiple LLM Provider Integrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Integrate with multiple LLM providers to allow for flexible routing and provider failover. Focus on testable routing decisions based on provider capabilities.
### Details:
Implement an abstraction layer to interact with different LLM providers. Ensure the system can seamlessly switch between providers based on availability and performance.

## 3. Enable Plugin Extensibility for Routing [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Design and implement a plugin architecture to allow for extending the routing capabilities of the system. Focus on testable routing decisions based on plugin functionality.
### Details:
Develop a plugin interface that allows developers to create custom routing logic. Ensure the system can dynamically load and execute plugins.

## 4. Implement Dynamic Routing Logic Based on Context [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Implement dynamic routing logic that considers user intent, context, and LLM provider capabilities to make routing decisions. Focus on testable routing decisions based on context.
### Details:
Develop a routing engine that can dynamically adjust routing decisions based on real-time data. Consider factors such as user intent, context, and LLM provider availability.

## 5. Handle Provider Failover Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.4
### Description: Implement mechanisms to handle LLM provider failover, ensuring continuous operation of the routing system. Focus on testable failover scenarios.
### Details:
Implement health checks for LLM providers. Develop a failover strategy that automatically switches to a backup provider if the primary provider is unavailable.

## 6. Optimize Routing Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4, 16.5
### Description: Optimize the routing system for performance, ensuring low latency and high throughput. Focus on testable performance metrics.
### Details:
Profile the routing system to identify performance bottlenecks. Implement caching and other optimization techniques to improve performance.
