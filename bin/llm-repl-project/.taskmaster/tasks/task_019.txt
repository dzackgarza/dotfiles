USER STORY: As a developer observing AI processing, I want to see a clear visualization of the multi-step reasoning process so I can understand how the system arrives at its conclusions. When the AI processes my request, I should see: 1) Intent analysis results showing what the AI understood, 2) Router decisions showing which path was chosen and why, 3) Plugin activations with their purposes, 4) Intermediate reasoning steps with confidence scores, 5) Final synthesis process. All of this should be displayed in real-time within the Cognition blocks in the Sacred Timeline.

# Test Strategy:
Verify LLM routing accuracy, plugin orchestration, reasoning visualization, and Cognition block display. Test with various scenarios.
