# Task ID: 44
# Title: Continuous Complexity Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 42, 43
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement ongoing complexity management by establishing metrics and thresholds for acceptable complexity, creating automated checks for architectural violations, and integrating with the development workflow.
# Details:
1. Establish metrics and thresholds for acceptable complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, coupling).
2. Create automated checks for architectural violations (e.g., circular dependencies).
3. Regular review cycles for new code additions.
4. Clear escalation path when complexity increases.
5. Integration with development workflow to prevent complexity drift by implementing automated checks and creating a review process.

# Test Strategy:
Monitor the complexity metrics and architectural violations over time to ensure that the complexity management system is effective. Ensure that the automated checks are accurate and that the review process is followed.
