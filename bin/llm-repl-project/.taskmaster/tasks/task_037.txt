# Task ID: 37
# Title: Plugin System Rationalization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35
# Priority: medium
# Description: Streamline the plugin architecture by simplifying plugin registration and discovery mechanisms, and reducing the plugin API surface area.
# Details:
1. Simplify plugin registration and discovery mechanisms.
2. Eliminate over-engineered plugin validation layers.
3. Consolidate plugin communication patterns.
4. Reduce plugin API surface area to essential functionality.
5. Ensure clear separation between core plugins and extensions by refactoring the plugin architecture.

# Test Strategy:
Test the streamlined plugin architecture by creating integration tests that verify the plugin registration and discovery mechanisms. Ensure that the reduced plugin API surface area still provides the necessary functionality.
