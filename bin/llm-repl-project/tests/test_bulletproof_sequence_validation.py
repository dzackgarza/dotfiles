Bulletproof Sequence Validation Tests

These tests validate the EXPECTED user experience sequence:
1. System_Check appears immediately on launch
2. Welcome appears after System_Check  
3. Prompt appears after Welcome (indicating ready for input)
4. User interaction works correctly after proper startup
