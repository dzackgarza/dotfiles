# Notification Strategy

**Branch:** docs/notification-strategy
**Summary:** Define a clear strategy for handling application notifications, prioritizing external system notifications (e.g., `notify-send`) or a dedicated internal debug console over intrusive internal UI notifications.
**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-07-10
**Updated:** 2025-07-10

## Context

### Problem Statement
Overuse or poor implementation of internal UI notifications can disrupt user workflow and clutter the interface. A well-defined strategy is needed to ensure notifications are informative, non-intrusive, and delivered through appropriate channels.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Critical user-facing alerts use external notification systems (e.g., `notify-send` on Linux).
- [ ] Debugging and internal system messages are routed to a dedicated internal debug console (`debug-console-logging.md`).
- [ ] Minimal use of transient, in-app UI notifications that block interaction.
- [ ] Notification channels are configurable.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User receives important alerts without UI disruption.
- [ ] Developers can access comprehensive logs in the debug console.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Changes
- Centralized notification dispatcher.
- Integration with external notification tools (e.g., `subprocess` for `notify-send`).
- Integration with `debug-console-logging.md` for internal logs.

### Implementation Plan
1.  Implement a `NotificationManager` class.
2.  Define notification types (e.g., `ALERT`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`).
3.  Route `ALERT` notifications to external system (if available).
4.  Route `DEBUG`/`INFO` notifications to the internal debug console.
5.  Replace existing `self.notify()` calls with `NotificationManager` calls.

### Dependencies
- `debug-console-logging.md` feature.
- OS-specific notification tools.

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Cross-platform compatibility for external notifications.
  - *Mitigation*: Use platform-agnostic libraries if possible; provide graceful degradation for unsupported systems.
- **Risk**: Over-notifying users.
  - *Mitigation*: Implement notification throttling and user preferences for notification frequency.

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-10 - Initial Planning
- Created feature ledger.
- Defined requirements and success criteria.
- Outlined technical approach.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: External vs. Internal Notifications
**Context**: Where to display different types of notifications.
**Options**: All in-app, all external, hybrid.
**Decision**: Hybrid - critical alerts external, debug/info internal console.
**Reasoning**: Balances user experience (non-intrusive alerts) with developer needs (detailed logs).

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `NotificationManager` routing logic.

### Integration Tests
- [ ] E2E test: Verify external notifications are triggered.
- [ ] E2E test: Verify logs appear in debug console.

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update user documentation on notification behavior.
- [ ] Update developer documentation on notification best practices.

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Requirements
- N/A

### Rollback Plan
N/A

## Review & Feedback

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Notification strategy is implemented consistently.
- [ ] Notifications are non-intrusive.

## Completion

### Final Status
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met.
