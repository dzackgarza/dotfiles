# UI Navigation Principles

**Branch:** docs/ui-navigation-principles
**Summary:** Document core UI navigation principles, emphasizing consistent behavior for common actions like backing out of menus/overlays using the Escape key.
**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-07-10
**Updated:** 2025-07-10

## Context

### Problem Statement
Inconsistent navigation patterns can lead to a frustrating user experience. Establishing clear principles, especially for common actions like closing overlays, ensures predictability and ease of use.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Escape key consistently closes the topmost menu/overlay.
- [ ] Repeated Escape presses eventually return to the main chat interface.
- [ ] No unexpected behavior when pressing Escape.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can intuitively navigate back through UI layers.
- [ ] Navigation behavior is documented and adhered to across all UI components.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Changes
- Centralized event handling for Escape key in `LLMReplApp` or a navigation manager.
- UI components (menus, overlays) must implement a standard method for handling `Esc` and signaling their closure.

### Implementation Plan
1.  Define a `Navigable` protocol or interface for UI components that can be escaped from.
2.  Implement a navigation stack in `LLMReplApp` to track active overlays/menus.
3.  Handle `Esc` key event in `LLMReplApp` to pop from the navigation stack and close the current overlay.
4.  Ensure all new UI components adhere to this principle.

### Dependencies
- `LLMReplApp`.
- All UI components that can be escaped from.

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Conflicts with component-specific `Esc` handling.
  - *Mitigation*: Establish clear event propagation rules; prioritize global navigation over local component handling.
- **Risk**: Complex navigation states leading to unexpected behavior.
  - *Mitigation*: Keep navigation stack simple; rigorously test all navigation paths.

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-10 - Initial Planning
- Created feature ledger.
- Defined requirements and success criteria.
- Outlined technical approach.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Centralized Navigation Stack
**Context**: How to manage multiple layers of UI (menus, overlays).
**Options**: Decentralized handling in each component, centralized stack.
**Decision**: Centralized navigation stack in `LLMReplApp`.
**Reasoning**: Ensures consistent behavior, simplifies global keybinding management, and provides a clear overview of UI state.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test navigation stack push/pop logic.

### Integration Tests
- [ ] E2E test: Open multiple overlays and verify `Esc` key navigation back to main chat.

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update developer documentation on UI navigation principles.
- [ ] Update user documentation on `Esc` key behavior.

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Requirements
- N/A

### Rollback Plan
N/A

## Review & Feedback

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Navigation is consistent and predictable.
- [ ] No `Esc` key conflicts.

## Completion

### Final Status
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met.
