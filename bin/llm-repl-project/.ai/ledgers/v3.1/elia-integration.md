# Ledger: Elia Integration

**Goal:** To seamlessly integrate our LLM REPL components into the existing "Elia App" codebase, leveraging its infrastructure while preserving our core philosophies and features.

## 1. Core Philosophy

- **Minimal Stripping:** Identify and remove only the absolutely necessary parts of the "Elia App" that conflict with our LLM REPL's core functionality or architectural principles.
- **Seamless Integration:** Ensure our LLM REPL components function as if they were native to the "Elia App" environment, particularly concerning UI rendering, event handling, and background processing.
- **Preserve Core Philosophies:** Maintain the Sacred Timeline, Transparent Cognition Pipeline, and terminal-native aesthetic.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Core LLM Interaction Logic Integration

#### Feature

- Integrate our project's core LLM interaction logic, including provider abstraction and intelligent routing, into the Elia TUI framework.

#### Implementation Details

-   **LLM Provider Abstraction:** Adapt our `LLMProvider` implementations (e.g., `OllamaProvider`, `GoogleGeminiProvider`) to be directly integrated or wrapped by Elia's existing model handling.
-   **Intelligent Routing:** Incorporate our `IntelligentRouter` to dynamically select the optimal LLM based on task type, performance benchmarks, and constraints, before Elia makes an LLM call.
-   **Model Configuration and Persistence:** Integrate our flexible model configuration and persistence with Elia's system.

### 2.2. Display Adaptation

#### Feature

- Adapt our project's rich content display features, primarily leveraging `textual.widgets.RichLog`, into Elia's output rendering system.

#### Implementation Details

-   **`textual.widgets.RichLog` Integration:** Integrate `RichLog` into Elia's layout to serve as the main conversation display area.
-   **Markdown Rendering:** Ensure Markdown content is rendered with proper formatting and syntax highlighting for code blocks.
-   **Code Block Syntax Highlighting:** Ensure correct syntax highlighting for code snippets.
-   **Structured Data Display:** Support displaying structured data using `rich.table.Table` and `rich.panel.Panel`.
-   **Dynamic Updates and Scrolling:** Ensure efficient handling of continuous content appending and smooth scrolling.

### 2.3. Input Adaptation

#### Feature

- Adapt our project's desired rich input features, including `TextArea` usage, autocomplete, Fzf integration, persistent history, and custom keybindings, into Elia's keyboard-centric input system.

#### Implementation Details

-   **`textual.widgets.TextArea` as Input Box:** Replace or augment Elia's current input widget with `TextArea` for advanced editing capabilities.
-   **Autocomplete Integration:** Integrate context-aware autocomplete using a solution compatible with `TextArea`.
-   **Fzf Integration:** Leverage Textual's `App.suspend()` to integrate `fzf` for history search, directory search, and custom data searches.
-   **Persistent Command History:** Integrate our persistent command history with Elia's input system.
-   **Custom Keybindings:** Implement Zsh-like keybindings (Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right, Ctrl+W) within the `TextArea`.

## 3. Success Criteria

-   Our `LLMProvider` instances can be successfully registered and used by Elia's core interaction loop.
-   The `IntelligentRouter` can intercept LLM requests within Elia and dynamically select the appropriate model based on our criteria.
-   Elia's configuration system can accommodate or integrate with our model performance data and preferences.
-   API keys and sensitive configurations are handled securely within the integrated system.
-   Elia's main display can effectively render `RichLog` content, including Markdown, syntax-highlighted code, tables, and panels.
-   Dynamic content updates and scrolling are handled efficiently without significant UI lag.
-   The visual fidelity of our rich content is maintained within Elia's TUI.
-   The main input box in Elia can be successfully replaced or extended with `TextArea`.
-   Autocomplete suggestions (commands, history, files) can be displayed and selected within the `TextArea`.
-   `fzf` can be launched via `App.suspend()` for history and directory searches, and selected items populate the `TextArea`.
-   Persistent command history is integrated and accessible.
-   Essential Zsh-like keybindings (Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right, Ctrl+W) function as expected within the `TextArea`.
