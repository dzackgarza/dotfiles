# Ledger: Double Ctrl+C Exit Confirmation

**Goal:** To implement a user-friendly exit confirmation mechanism that prevents accidental application termination, requiring two consecutive `Ctrl+C` presses to exit.

## 1. Core Philosophy

-   **User Safety:** Prevent accidental loss of work or interruption of ongoing processes due to a single, inadvertent `Ctrl+C` press.
-   **Clear Feedback:** Provide immediate and unambiguous feedback to the user about the state of their exit attempt.

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1. First Ctrl+C Press

#### Feature

-   Upon the first `Ctrl+C` press, the application will not immediately exit.

#### Implementation Details

-   Intercept the `SIGINT` signal (or equivalent for the operating system).
-   Instead of terminating, display a prominent message to the user, such as "Press Ctrl+C again to exit" or "Press Ctrl+C again within X seconds to confirm exit."
-   Start a short timer (e.g., 2-3 seconds) during which the second `Ctrl+C` press must occur.

### 2.2. Second Ctrl+C Press

#### Feature

-   If `Ctrl+C` is pressed again within the specified time window, the application will exit.

#### Implementation Details

-   If a second `SIGINT` is received within the active timer, proceed with normal application shutdown.
-   If the timer expires before the second `Ctrl+C` is pressed, reset the state, and the next `Ctrl+C` will be treated as the first.

### 2.3. Visual and Auditory Feedback

#### Feature

-   Provide clear visual feedback for both the initial message and the successful exit.

#### Implementation Details

-   The confirmation message should be displayed in a noticeable but non-intrusive manner (e.g., a temporary status bar message, a small overlay).
-   Consider a subtle sound cue or visual animation for the confirmation message (optional).

### 2.4. Edge Cases and Considerations

#### Feature

-   Handle scenarios where `Ctrl+C` might be pressed rapidly or in quick succession.

#### Implementation Details

-   Ensure the timer mechanism is robust against rapid presses.
-   Consider if there are any long-running operations that might be interrupted by the first `Ctrl+C` and how to gracefully handle them (e.g., saving state before prompting for exit).
-   Document any exceptions or scenarios where this double `Ctrl+C` behavior might be bypassed (e.g., during critical system operations).
