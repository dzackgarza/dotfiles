# Debug Console / Logging View

**Branch:** feat/debug-console-logging
**Summary:** Implement an internal debug console or logging view, accessible via Ctrl+L, to display application logs and debugging information.
**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-07-10
**Updated:** 2025-07-10

## Context

### Problem Statement
For development and troubleshooting, it's crucial to have access to real-time application logs and debugging output directly within the TUI, without relying solely on external terminal output or log files.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Pressing Ctrl+L (or similar) toggles a debug console overlay/screen.
- [ ] The debug console displays application logs (e.g., from Python's `logging` module).
- [ ] Logs are color-coded by level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG).
- [ ] The console is scrollable and can be cleared.
- [ ] Pressing Esc closes the debug console.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can view real-time application logs.
- [ ] Debug console does not interfere with main application performance.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Changes
- New `DebugConsole` widget.
- Integration with Python's `logging` module to redirect logs to the widget.
- Management of console display (overlay or separate screen).

### Implementation Plan
1.  Design `DebugConsole` widget layout.
2.  Configure Python `logging` to output to the `DebugConsole`.
3.  Add a global keybinding (Ctrl+L) to `LLMReplApp` to toggle the console.
4.  Implement scrolling and clearing functionality.

### Dependencies
- Python's `logging` module.
- `LLMReplApp`.

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Performance impact from high volume logging.
  - *Mitigation*: Implement log buffering; limit displayed lines; optimize rendering.
- **Risk**: Security implications of exposing sensitive debug info.
  - *Mitigation*: Ensure debug mode is off in production; filter sensitive data from logs.

## Progress Log

### 2025-07-10 - Initial Planning
- Created feature ledger.
- Defined requirements and success criteria.
- Outlined technical approach.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Logging Integration
**Context**: How to capture and display application logs.
**Options**: Custom message passing, `logging.Handler` subclass.
**Decision**: Custom `logging.Handler` subclass.
**Reasoning**: Standard Python logging mechanism, allows easy integration with existing log calls.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `DebugConsole` rendering with various log messages.

### Integration Tests
- [ ] E2E test: Open and close debug console; verify log messages appear.

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update developer documentation on logging and debugging.

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Requirements
- N/A

### Rollback Plan
N/A

## Review & Feedback

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Debug console is functional and stable.
- [ ] Logging does not impact performance.

## Completion

### Final Status
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met.
