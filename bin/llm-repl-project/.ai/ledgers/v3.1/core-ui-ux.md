## UI Framework Research

### Terminal UI (TUI) Options

**Textual Framework**
- **Pros**: Modern, web-inspired development patterns, built on Rich
- **Cons**: Still maturing, async complexity, missing basic features (menus, dialogs)
- **Verdict**: Promising but not yet production-ready for complex apps

**Rich Library**
- **Pros**: Excellent for enhanced terminal output
- **Cons**: Limited interactivity, not a full TUI framework
- **Verdict**: Great for output formatting, insufficient for full application

### GUI Framework Options

**Tkinter (Current V3 Choice)**
- **Pros**: Built-in, zero dependencies, stable, cross-platform
- **Cons**: Somewhat outdated aesthetics, limited multimedia support
- **Performance**: Adequate for text-based applications
- **Verdict**: Optimal for our use case - reliable and lightweight

**PySide6/PyQt6**
- **Pros**: Professional appearance, comprehensive features, excellent performance
- **Cons**: Large dependencies, licensing considerations, complexity overhead
- **Verdict**: Overkill for our terminal-focused application

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Planning** - Review and plan implementation
2. **Phase 2: Implementation** - Core development work
3. **Phase 3: Testing** - Testing and validation
4. **Phase 4: UX Polish** - Final polish and user experience improvements
5. **Phase 5: Integration** - Integrate ledger into the main system
