# Ledger: Dependency Management Plugin

**Goal:** To define the capabilities and contract of an LLM-powered Dependency Management Plugin, enabling it to intelligently identify, install, update, and resolve conflicts for project dependencies across various ecosystems.

## 1. Core Philosophy

-   **Automated Dependency Handling:** Streamline the process of managing project dependencies, reducing manual effort and potential errors.
-   **Intelligent Conflict Resolution:** Leverage LLM capabilities to understand and propose solutions for complex dependency conflicts.
-   **Ecosystem Agnostic:** Support a wide range of programming language ecosystems and their respective package managers.

## 2. Plugin Capabilities

### 2.1. Dependency Identification and Analysis

#### Feature

-   The plugin will be able to identify project dependencies and analyze their current state.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Manifest File Parsing:** Read and parse common dependency manifest files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`).
-   **Version Analysis:** Identify installed versions, required versions, and available updates for dependencies.
-   **Vulnerability Scanning (Future):** Integrate with vulnerability databases to flag known security issues in dependencies.

### 2.2. Dependency Installation and Updating

#### Feature

-   The plugin will be able to install new dependencies and update existing ones.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Package Manager Integration:** Utilize `run_shell_command` to interact with various package managers (e.g., `npm`, `yarn`, `pip`, `go get`, `cargo`, `gradle`, `mvn`).
-   **Version Specification:** Support installing specific versions or ranges of dependencies.
-   **Automated Updates:** Propose and apply updates to dependencies based on project policies or user requests.

### 2.3. Conflict Detection and Resolution

#### Feature

-   The plugin will detect dependency conflicts and propose intelligent solutions.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Conflict Parsing:** Analyze error messages from package managers or build tools that indicate dependency conflicts.
-   **LLM-driven Resolution:** The plugin's internal LLM will analyze the conflict, consider the project's context and existing dependencies, and propose solutions (e.g., suggesting alternative versions, recommending exclusion rules, or identifying breaking changes).
-   **Interactive Resolution:** If necessary, guide the user through a series of questions to resolve complex conflicts.

### 2.4. Dependency Cleanup

#### Feature

-   The plugin will identify and suggest removal of unused or redundant dependencies.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Code Analysis:** Analyze code to determine if declared dependencies are actually being used.
-   **Suggestion Generation:** Propose removal of unused dependencies to reduce project size and build times.

## 3. Interface with Assistant

-   The Dependency Management Plugin will expose an API to the main assistant for requesting dependency operations (install, update, analyze, resolve conflicts).
-   It will communicate its progress, findings, and any required user intervention back to the assistant for display and integration into the Sacred Timeline.
