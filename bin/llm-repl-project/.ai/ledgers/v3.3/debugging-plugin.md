# Ledger: Debugging Plugin

**Goal:** To define the capabilities and contract of an LLM-powered Debugging Plugin, enabling it to intelligently analyze error messages, logs, and code to diagnose issues, propose solutions, and potentially even generate debugging steps.

## 1. Core Philosophy

-   **Intelligent Diagnosis:** Leverage LLM capabilities to understand complex error scenarios and pinpoint root causes.
-   **Automated Troubleshooting:** Automate the process of gathering diagnostic information and suggesting fixes.
-   **Guided Resolution:** Provide clear, actionable guidance to the user or other plugins for resolving issues.

## 2. Plugin Capabilities

### 2.1. Error and Log Analysis

#### Feature

-   The plugin will be able to ingest and analyze various forms of error messages and log files.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Log Ingestion:** Read log files (e.g., application logs, system logs, test runner output) using `read_file` or `read_many_files`.
-   **Error Pattern Recognition:** The LLM will identify common error patterns, stack traces, and warning messages.
-   **Contextual Understanding:** Analyze the surrounding code and execution context to better understand the error's origin and implications.

### 2.2. Diagnostic Information Gathering

#### Feature

-   The plugin will be able to intelligently request and gather additional diagnostic information.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Dynamic Querying:** Based on initial analysis, the LLM will formulate specific queries to gather more data (e.g., asking for variable values, specific file contents, or output of shell commands).
-   **Tool Utilization:** Use tools like `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `run_shell_command` to collect relevant data.
-   **Interactive Prompts:** If necessary, prompt the user for additional information or to perform specific actions (e.g., "Can you reproduce the error with debug logging enabled?").

### 2.3. Hypothesis Generation and Solution Proposal

#### Feature

-   The plugin will generate hypotheses about the root cause of an issue and propose potential solutions.

#### Implementation Details

-   **LLM Reasoning:** The LLM will use its understanding of code, common bugs, and the gathered diagnostics to formulate plausible explanations for the error.
-   **Solution Brainstorming:** Propose one or more potential solutions, ranging from code changes to configuration adjustments or environmental fixes.
-   **Confidence Scoring (Optional):** Assign a confidence score to each hypothesis or solution.

### 2.4. Debugging Step Generation

#### Feature

-   The plugin will be able to generate step-by-step debugging instructions.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Actionable Steps:** Provide clear, executable steps for the user or other plugins to follow to further diagnose or resolve the issue.
-   **Tool-based Steps:** Suggest commands to run, files to inspect, or specific code lines to examine.
-   **Iterative Debugging:** Support an iterative debugging process where the plugin refines its hypotheses and steps based on new information.

## 3. Interface with Assistant

-   The Debugging Plugin will expose an API to the main assistant for initiating debugging sessions, providing diagnostic data, and receiving proposed solutions or steps.
-   It will communicate its findings and actions back to the assistant for display to the user and integration into the Sacred Timeline.
