# Ledger: Code Quality Plugin

**Goal:** To define the capabilities and contract of an LLM-powered Code Quality Plugin, enabling it to intelligently identify, analyze, and suggest/apply fixes for code quality issues, ensuring adherence to project standards and best practices.

## 1. Core Philosophy

-   **Automated Code Review:** Automate aspects of code review to maintain high code quality and consistency.
-   **Proactive Issue Resolution:** Identify and address code quality issues early in the development cycle.
-   **Standard Adherence:** Ensure the codebase consistently follows defined coding standards, style guides, and best practices.

## 2. Plugin Capabilities

### 2.1. Linting and Formatting

#### Feature

-   The plugin will be able to run project-specific linters and formatters.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Tool Integration:** Support common linting and formatting tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Black, Ruff, Go fmt, clang-format) by identifying configuration files or common command-line invocations.
-   **Command Execution:** Utilize `run_shell_command` to execute linting and formatting commands.
-   **Output Parsing:** Parse tool output to identify warnings, errors, and formatting discrepancies.
-   **Automated Fixes:** Where tools support it, automatically apply fixes (e.g., `prettier --write`, `black`).

### 2.2. Static Analysis and Best Practice Enforcement

#### Feature

-   The plugin will perform static analysis to detect potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.

#### Implementation Details

-   **LLM-driven Analysis:** The plugin's internal LLM will analyze code snippets, considering context and common anti-patterns, to identify more subtle issues that traditional linters might miss.
-   **Customizable Rules:** Allow for project-specific rules or guidelines to be provided to the LLM for enforcement.
-   **Suggestion Generation:** Generate clear and concise suggestions for improving code quality, including explanations of *why* a change is recommended.

### 2.3. Code Refactoring Suggestions

#### Feature

-   The plugin will suggest refactoring opportunities to improve code readability, maintainability, and performance.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Pattern Recognition:** The LLM will identify common refactoring patterns (e.g., extracting functions, simplifying conditionals, reducing duplication).
-   **Impact Assessment:** Provide an assessment of the potential impact of suggested refactorings.
-   **Automated Refactoring (Limited):** For simple, well-defined refactorings, the plugin may automatically apply changes using `replace` or `edit_block`.

### 2.4. Dependency on Project Standards

#### Feature

-   The plugin will be able to ingest and understand project-specific coding standards and style guides.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Configuration File Reading:** Read and interpret configuration files (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `package.json`) to understand project dependencies and quality settings.
-   **Documentation Ingestion:** The LLM can process project documentation (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, internal style guides) to learn specific conventions.

## 3. Interface with Assistant

-   The Code Quality Plugin will expose an API to the main assistant for requesting code quality checks, applying fixes, and generating reports.
-   It will communicate its findings and actions back to the assistant for display to the user and integration into the Sacred Timeline.
