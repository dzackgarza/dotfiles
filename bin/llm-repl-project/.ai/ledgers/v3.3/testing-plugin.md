# Ledger: Testing Plugin

**Goal:** To define the capabilities and contract of an LLM-powered Testing Plugin, enabling it to intelligently interact with testing frameworks, execute tests, interpret results, and generate new tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.

## 1. Core Philosophy

-   **Automated Verification:** Automate the testing process to ensure code quality and reliability.
-   **Intelligent Test Generation:** Leverage LLM capabilities to generate relevant and effective test cases.
-   **Actionable Feedback:** Provide clear and actionable insights from test results.

## 2. Plugin Capabilities

### 2.1. Test Discovery and Execution

#### Feature

-   The plugin will be able to discover existing tests within the codebase and execute them.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Framework Agnostic:** Support common testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Vitest, Pytest, Go test) by identifying configuration files or common test file naming conventions.
-   **Command Execution:** Utilize `run_shell_command` to execute test commands.
-   **Output Parsing:** Parse test runner output to determine success/failure, identify failing tests, and extract error messages.

### 2.2. Test Result Interpretation

#### Feature

-   The plugin will interpret test results and provide a summary to the LLM.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Categorization:** Categorize test results (e.g., passed, failed, skipped, errors).
-   **Failure Analysis:** For failing tests, extract relevant information such as file paths, line numbers, and stack traces.
-   **LLM Interpretation:** The plugin's internal LLM will analyze test failures to identify potential root causes and suggest initial debugging steps.

### 2.3. Intelligent Test Generation

#### Feature

-   The plugin will be able to generate new test cases (unit, integration, end-to-end) based on code changes, requirements, or identified gaps.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Contextual Generation:** The LLM will analyze the target code, existing tests, and relevant documentation to generate new test cases.
-   **Test File Creation:** Use `write_file` to create new test files or append to existing ones.
-   **Test Data Generation:** Generate realistic test data for various scenarios.
-   **Coverage Analysis (Future):** Integrate with code coverage tools to identify areas lacking test coverage and prioritize test generation.

### 2.4. Test Refactoring and Maintenance

#### Feature

-   The plugin can assist in refactoring existing tests and keeping them up-to-date with code changes.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Outdated Test Detection:** Identify tests that are likely outdated due to changes in the codebase.
-   **Refactoring Suggestions:** Suggest modifications to existing tests to improve their readability, maintainability, or effectiveness.

## 3. Interface with Assistant

-   The Testing Plugin will expose a clear API to the main assistant for requesting test execution, test generation, and test analysis.
-   It will communicate its progress and results back to the assistant for display to the user and integration into the Sacred Timeline.
