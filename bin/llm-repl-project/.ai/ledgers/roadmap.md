# Feature: Roadmap and Future Development

**Created:** 2025-07-10
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Backlog
**Priority:** High

## Overview

The LLM REPL roadmap transforms the system from a simple question-answer interface into a powerful continuation-passing style (CPS) architecture where LLMs and local Python tools engage in continuous conversation loops, enabling complex reasoning-action-observation cycles.

## Vision

Create a sophisticated AI development tool that can:
- Execute complex, multi-step reasoning tasks
- Seamlessly integrate LLM intelligence with local tool execution
- Enable continuous conversation loops between AI and tools
- Support multi-agent collaboration
- Provide enterprise-ready features

## Current State (v3.0)

âœ… Completed:
- Plugin-based architecture with unified display system
- System check with LLM heartbeat validation
- Clean input system with multiline support
- Separate input/output token tracking
- Multiple LLM provider support (ollama, groq, mock)
- Cognitive modules for basic processing
- Comprehensive testing framework

## Phase 1: MVP (v3.1)

**Target: Q3 2025**

### Core Components

Features for v3.1 are detailed in the ledgers located in `/.ai/ledgers/v3.1/`.

## Phase 2: Continuation Passing Style (v3.2)

**Target: Q4 2025**

### Key Features

Features for v3.2 are detailed in the ledgers located in `/.ai/ledgers/v3.2/`.

## Phase 3: Advanced Reasoning (v3.3)

**Target: Q1 2026**

### Key Features

Features for v3.3 are detailed in the ledgers located in `/.ai/ledgers/v3.3/`.

## Phase 4: Production Ready (v4.0)

**Target: Q2 2026**

### Enterprise Features

## Success Metrics

- **Functionality**: Successfully complete multi-step reasoning tasks
- **Performance**: Sub-second tool execution times
- **Security**: Zero security vulnerabilities in tool execution
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for CPS loops
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interaction with complex workflows

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Security**: Code execution vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: LLM context window limitations
- **Reliability**: Tool execution failures
- **Complexity**: System maintenance overhead

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased implementation with fallbacks
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and security testing
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health monitoring
- **Documentation**: Extensive user and developer documentation

## Contributing Guidelines

1. **Security First**: All code must pass security review
2. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% test coverage required
3. **Documentation**: Complete API and user documentation
4. **Performance**: Benchmark all major features
5. **Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility

## Architecture Principles

- **Modularity**: Loosely coupled, highly cohesive components
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities
- **Observability**: Complete logging and monitoring
- **Resilience**: Graceful degradation and error recovery
- **Simplicity**: Complex functionality with simple interfaces

This roadmap represents a significant evolution from simple Q&A to a sophisticated reasoning system that can perform complex, multi-step tasks through continuous LLM-tool collaboration.
