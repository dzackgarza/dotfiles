# Ledger: Automated Tool Error Recovery and Self-Correction

**Goal:** To enable the AI to automatically detect, diagnose, and attempt to recover from tool execution failures, including learning from past errors to improve future performance.

## 1. Core Philosophy

- **Resilience:** The system should be robust to tool failures and strive to complete tasks even when unexpected errors occur.
- **Autonomy:** Reduce the need for human intervention when tools fail.
- **Learning:** Improve the AI's ability to use tools correctly over time.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Error Detection and Classification

#### Feature

- Automatically detect tool execution errors and classify them into categories (e.g., invalid arguments, permission denied, network error, unexpected output format).

#### Implementation Details

-   **Tool Wrapper:** All tool executions will be wrapped to catch exceptions and capture stdout/stderr.
-   **LLM-Powered Classification:** A dedicated LLM (from `llm-routing-and-cognitive-plugins.md`) will analyze the error messages, stack traces, and tool outputs to classify the error type.

### 2.2. Recovery Strategies

#### Feature

- Based on the error classification, the AI will attempt different recovery strategies.

#### Implementation Details

1.  **Argument Correction:** If the error is classified as "invalid arguments," the AI will re-examine the tool's schema and the original prompt to generate corrected arguments.
2.  **Retry with Backoff:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues), implement a retry with exponential backoff (leveraging `safety-and-robustness.md`).
3.  **Alternative Tool Selection:** If a tool consistently fails, the AI will consult the `Intelligent Tool Router` (from `llm-routing-and-cognitive-plugins.md`) to find an alternative tool for the same task.
4.  **Clarification:** If the error is ambiguous or requires user input, the AI will ask clarifying questions (linking to `interactive-clarification.md`).
5.  **Escalation:** If all automated recovery attempts fail, the AI will report the error to the user with a detailed explanation and suggestions for manual intervention.

### 2.3. Self-Correction and Learning

#### Feature

- The AI will learn from successful and failed tool recovery attempts to improve its future tool usage.

#### Implementation Details

-   **Feedback Loop:** Successful recovery strategies and their associated error types will be recorded.
-   **Prompt Refinement:** The AI will refine its internal prompts for tool usage based on past successes and failures.
-   **Knowledge Base Update:** Failed tool calls and their resolutions can be added to the RAG system (`memory-and-context-management.md`) as negative examples or lessons learned.

## 3. Integration Points

-   **`llm-routing-and-cognitive-plugins.md`:** For LLM-powered error classification and alternative tool selection.
-   **`safety-and-robustness.md`:** Leverages existing retry mechanisms.
-   **`file-editing-system.md`:** Specifically for handling errors during patch application.
-   **`project-and-task-management.md`:** Integrates with task management to update task status on tool failures/successes.

## 4. Advanced Features

-   **Proactive Error Prediction:** The AI could attempt to predict potential tool errors before execution based on input parameters.
-   **Automated Debugging:** For code-related tool errors, the AI could attempt to debug the code itself.
