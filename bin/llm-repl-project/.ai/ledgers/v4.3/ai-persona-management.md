# Ledger: AI Persona and Identity Management

**Goal:** To enable the system to maintain a consistent AI persona, tone, and style, and to allow users to customize these aspects for a more personalized and predictable interaction.

## 1. Core Philosophy

- **Consistency:** The AI's responses should reflect a stable and predictable personality.
- **Personalization:** Users should be able to tailor the AI's persona to their preferences or specific task requirements.
- **Transparency:** Clearly define the default persona and how it can be modified.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Persona Definition

#### Feature

- Define a default AI persona, including its name, role, tone, and general behavioral guidelines.

#### Implementation Details

-   The default persona will be defined in a dedicated configuration file (e.g., `persona.yaml` or within `settings.yaml`).
-   This definition will include:
    -   `name`: (e.g., "Gemini CLI Assistant", "Elia")
    -   `role`: (e.g., "helpful software engineering assistant", "creative writing partner")
    -   `tone`: (e.g., "professional", "friendly", "concise")
    -   `style_guidelines`: Specific instructions on how to format responses, use language, etc.

### 2.2. Persona Injection

#### Feature

- The defined persona will be consistently injected into the LLM's system prompt for every interaction.

#### Implementation Details

-   The persona definition will be part of the system-level context provided to the LLM, ensuring it influences all responses.
-   This will be integrated with the `memory-and-context-management.md` ledger's hierarchical context loading, potentially as a high-priority, immutable system context.

### 2.3. User Customization

#### Feature

- Allow users to override or extend the default persona settings.

#### Implementation Details

-   **`/persona set <attribute> <value>`:** A command to allow users to modify specific persona attributes (e.g., `/persona set tone friendly`).
-   **`/persona load <profile_name>`:** Allow users to load predefined persona profiles.
-   **`/persona reset`:** Reset the persona to its default settings.
-   **Persistence:** User customizations will be saved in the user's settings file.

## 3. Advanced Features

-   **Dynamic Persona Switching:** Allow the AI to switch personas based on the task or user's explicit request.
-   **Persona Learning:** The AI could learn from user feedback and adapt its persona over time (with user approval).
-   **Multi-Agent Persona:** For multi-agent systems, each agent could have its own distinct persona.
