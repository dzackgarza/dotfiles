## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Maintain sub-500 line modules** for debuggability
- **Comprehensive testing** for all new features  
- **Echo tests** for user experience validation
- **API key rotation** for cost management across 8 providers

### Architecture Principles
- **Fail fast design** - expose problems immediately
- **Proof-based validation** - working code demonstrates correctness  
- **Component isolation** - UI changes don't affect business logic
- **Progressive enhancement** - add complexity only when needed
