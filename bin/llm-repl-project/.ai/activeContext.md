# Active Context: LLM REPL - Current Work Focus

## Current Work Focus

Our primary focus is to implement the Sacred GUI Architecture, specifically the three-area layout (Sacred Timeline, Live Workspace, Input) using Textual's VerticalScroll pattern, as proven in V3.

## Recent Changes

*   **Memory Bank Integration**: Initiated the restructuring of `.ai` documentation to align with the Cline Memory Bank paradigm.
*   **Core File Creation**: Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` within the `.ai/` directory, populating them with high-level project vision and user experience goals.

## Next Steps

1.  Continue populating the remaining core Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) within the `.ai/` directory.
2.  Update agent instructions in `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` to reflect the new Memory Bank structure and usage.
3.  Refine and verify the new documentation structure and agent behavior.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   **Content Consolidation**: Ensuring that content migrated to the core Memory Bank files is concise and high-level, with detailed information remaining in or being linked to from other specialized `.ai` documents.
*   **Agent Instruction Clarity**: Making sure the updated `CLAUDE.md` clearly guides the agent on how to interact with the new Memory Bank system, including when to read and when to update the files.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   The Cline Memory Bank provides a robust framework for persistent context, which is crucial for overcoming LLM context window limitations.
*   Blending the existing `.ai` structure with the Memory Bank paradigm requires careful content mapping and consolidation to avoid redundancy and maintain clarity.
