# The Sacred Timeline: Conceptual Diagram

This diagram illustrates the core concept of the Sacred Timeline, an immutable, append-only log of all interactions within the LLM REPL. It emphasizes the grouping of interactions into "Turns" and the transparent, detailed breakdown of the "Cognition" phase, including time and token metrics for each submodule.
