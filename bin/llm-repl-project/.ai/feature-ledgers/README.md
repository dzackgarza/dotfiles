# Feature Ledgers

This directory contains a set of feature ledgers, which are used to track the development of new features in the project. Each feature ledger is a Markdown file that describes a specific feature, including its goals, requirements, and implementation details.

## How to Use This Directory

When you are working on a new feature, you should create a new feature ledger in this directory to track its development. You should then update the feature ledger as you make progress on the feature, and use it to communicate with other developers about the feature's status.

## Feature Ledger Template

Each feature ledger should follow a common template, which includes the following sections:

- **Feature**: A brief description of the feature.
- **Goals**: The goals of the feature, including the problems it is trying to solve and the benefits it will provide.
- **Requirements**: The requirements for the feature, including the functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Implementation Details**: The implementation details of the feature, including the technical design, the technologies that will be used, and the steps that will be taken to implement the feature.
- **Status**: The current status of the feature, including the progress that has been made and the next steps that will be taken.
