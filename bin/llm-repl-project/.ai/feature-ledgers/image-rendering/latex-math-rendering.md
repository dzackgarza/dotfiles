# Feature: LaTeX Math Rendering

## Overview

This feature enables the display of complex mathematical equations within the Textual TUI application by rendering LaTeX code into images and then displaying these images using the Kitty graphics protocol via `chafa`. This provides high-quality, visually accurate mathematical notation.

## Sub-Features and User Tests

### 1. LaTeX to Image Conversion

**Description:** The system will use an external tool (e.g., `latex` + `dvipng`, or a Python library like `matplotlib` with `mathtext`, or an online service) to convert LaTeX mathematical expressions into image files (e.g., PNG).

**User Stories:**
- As a user, when I encounter mathematical notation in the system's output, it should be rendered clearly and correctly.
- As a developer, I can provide a LaTeX string, and the system will convert it into a displayable image.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 1.1 (Basic Inline Math Rendering):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal. Necessary LaTeX rendering tools are installed and configured.
    - **Action:** The system displays a text containing an inline mathematical expression (e.g., "The equation $E=mc^2$ is famous.").
    - **Expected Outcome:** The `$E=mc^2$` part is replaced by a clear, rendered image of the equation, seamlessly integrated into the text flow.
- **Test 1.2 (Display Equation Rendering):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal. Necessary LaTeX rendering tools are installed and configured.
    - **Action:** The system displays a block-level mathematical expression (e.g., "$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$").
    - **Expected Outcome:** The equation is rendered as a centered, clear image, distinct from surrounding text.
- **Test 1.3 (Complex Equation Rendering):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal. Necessary LaTeX rendering tools are installed and configured.
    - **Action:** The system displays a complex LaTeX equation involving fractions, superscripts, subscripts, and special symbols (e.g., "$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right)$$").
    - **Expected Outcome:** The complex equation is rendered accurately and legibly as an image.

### 2. Integration with Chafa and Textual

**Description:** The generated math images will be displayed within the Textual TUI using the `chafa` integration with the Kitty graphics protocol, ensuring high-quality visual output.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I expect mathematical equations to be displayed with the same high quality as other images in the application.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 2.1 (Image Display Quality):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal. A LaTeX equation has been converted to an image.
    - **Action:** The system displays the generated math image.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The math image is rendered sharply and clearly, without pixelation or distortion, leveraging Kitty's pixel rendering capabilities.
- **Test 2.2 (Dynamic Math Rendering):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal. The system can generate LaTeX equations dynamically (e.g., from an LLM response).
    - **Action:** The system receives a new mathematical expression in LaTeX format and displays it.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The new equation is converted to an image and displayed promptly and correctly in the Textual UI.

### 3. Error Handling for LaTeX Conversion

**Description:** The system will gracefully handle errors during LaTeX to image conversion (e.g., malformed LaTeX, missing tools) and provide informative feedback.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, if a mathematical expression cannot be rendered, I should be informed of the problem.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 3.1 (Malformed LaTeX Input):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal.
    - **Action:** The system attempts to render a malformed LaTeX string (e.g., "$E=mc^2").
    - **Expected Outcome:** An error message is displayed in the Textual UI, indicating that the LaTeX could not be rendered, along with the problematic input or a suggestion for correction.
- **Test 3.2 (Missing LaTeX Tools):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal, but the necessary external LaTeX compilation tools (e.g., `pdflatex`, `dvipng`) are not installed or found in PATH.
    - **Action:** The system attempts to render a valid LaTeX string.
    - **Expected Outcome:** An error message is displayed in the Textual UI, informing the user about the missing external dependencies required for LaTeX rendering.
