# Feature: Rich Image Rendering (Kitty + Chafa)

## Overview

This feature integrates the `chafa` utility with Textual, leveraging the Kitty graphics protocol to display high-fidelity images directly within the terminal. This provides a visually rich experience, moving beyond character-based art for image representation.

## Sub-Features and User Tests

### 1. Core Image Display via Kitty Graphics Protocol

**Description:** The system will execute `chafa` with the `--format=kitty` option, capture its output, and display it within a Textual widget, rendering images as pixels in the Kitty terminal.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, when an image is presented by the system, I expect to see a clear, high-resolution representation of the image, not character art.
- As a developer, I can easily display an image file within the Textual application, knowing it will render correctly in Kitty.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 1.1 (Static Image Display):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal. A test image file (`test_image.png`) is available.
    - **Action:** The system is instructed to display `test_image.png` (e.g., via a command or a specific application state).
    - **Expected Outcome:** `test_image.png` is rendered as a full-color, pixel-accurate image within the Textual UI. The image should be clearly distinguishable and not appear as character art.
- **Test 1.2 (Image Resizing on Terminal Resize):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal and displaying `test_image.png`.
    - **Action:** The user resizes the Kitty terminal window.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The displayed image dynamically resizes to fit the new terminal dimensions, maintaining its aspect ratio and clarity. There should be minimal flickering or delay during resizing.
- **Test 1.3 (Error Handling - Missing Image):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal.
    - **Action:** The system attempts to display a non-existent image file (`non_existent.jpg`).
    - **Expected Outcome:** An informative error message is displayed in the Textual UI, indicating that the image could not be loaded or found, instead of a broken image or application crash.
- **Test 1.4 (Error Handling - Chafa Not Found):**
    - **Precondition:** The `chafa` executable is not in the system's PATH.
    - **Action:** The system attempts to display an image.
    - **Expected Outcome:** An informative error message is displayed in the Textual UI, indicating that `chafa` is not found and suggesting its installation.

### 2. Dynamic Image Updates

**Description:** The system can update displayed images in response to changes in data or application state, such as displaying a sequence of images or a dynamically generated plot.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, when the system generates a new plot or visual output, it should be immediately reflected in the UI.
- As a developer, I can programmatically update the image displayed in a Textual widget.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 2.1 (Sequential Image Display):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal. A sequence of test images (`frame1.png`, `frame2.png`, `frame3.png`) is available.
    - **Action:** The system is instructed to display the images sequentially with a short delay between each.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The images are displayed one after another, with smooth transitions, demonstrating dynamic updates.
- **Test 2.2 (Plot Generation and Display):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal. A Python plotting library (e.g., Matplotlib) is available.
    - **Action:** The system generates a plot (e.g., a sine wave) and then updates the Textual UI to display this newly generated plot image.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The generated plot is rendered clearly and accurately within the Textual UI.

### 3. Terminal Compatibility Check

**Description:** The application will detect if it's running in the Kitty terminal and provide a clear warning or disable image features if not, ensuring a consistent user experience.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, if I'm not using Kitty, I should be informed that image features may not work correctly.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 3.1 (Running in Non-Kitty Terminal):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is launched in a non-Kitty terminal (e.g., Gnome Terminal, Alacritty).
    - **Action:** The application starts.
    - **Expected Outcome:** A prominent warning message is displayed to the user, indicating that the application is optimized for Kitty and image rendering may be affected. The application should still function, but image areas might be blank or garbled.
- **Test 3.2 (Running in Kitty Terminal):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is launched in the Kitty terminal.
    - **Action:** The application starts.
    - **Expected Outcome:** No warning message regarding terminal compatibility is displayed, and image features function as expected.
