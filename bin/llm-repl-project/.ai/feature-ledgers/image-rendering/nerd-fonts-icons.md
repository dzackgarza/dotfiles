# Feature: Nerd Fonts and Rich Icons

## Overview

This feature ensures the Textual TUI application can effectively utilize Nerd Fonts to display a wide range of icons, enhancing the visual appeal and information density of the user interface. This leverages Kitty's excellent font rendering capabilities.

## Sub-Features and User Tests

### 1. Core Nerd Font Display

**Description:** The application will correctly render characters from Nerd Fonts, allowing for the display of various icons within text and UI elements.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I expect to see clear and distinct icons (e.g., file type icons, status indicators) throughout the application.
- As a developer, I can easily embed Nerd Font icons into Textual widgets and strings.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 1.1 (Basic Icon Display):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal, and a Nerd Font is configured as the terminal font.
    - **Action:** The application displays a string containing common Nerd Font icons (e.g., `` for folder, `` for Python file, `` for checkmark).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The icons are rendered correctly as their respective graphical symbols, not as empty boxes or question marks.
- **Test 1.2 (Icon Sizing and Alignment):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal with a Nerd Font.
    - **Action:** The application displays icons alongside text in various Textual widgets (e.g., `Label`, `Button`, `ListItem`).
    - **Expected Outcome:** Icons are appropriately sized and vertically aligned with the surrounding text, without causing layout issues.

### 2. Contextual Iconography

**Description:** Icons will be used contextually to convey information, such as file types in a file browser, status indicators for processes, or action buttons.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I can quickly understand the type of a file or the status of an operation by looking at its associated icon.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 2.1 (File Type Icons):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal with a Nerd Font. A file browser component is displayed.
    - **Action:** The file browser lists various file types (e.g., `document.txt`, `script.py`, `image.jpg`, `folder/`).
    - **Expected Outcome:** Each file and folder is prefixed with its appropriate Nerd Font icon (e.g., a text file icon, a Python logo icon, an image icon, a folder icon).
- **Test 2.2 (Status Indicators):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal with a Nerd Font. A process list or task manager component is displayed.
    - **Action:** The component displays items with different statuses (e.g., `Running`, `Paused`, `Completed`, `Error`).
    - **Expected Outcome:** Each status is clearly indicated by a distinct Nerd Font icon (e.g., a green play icon for running, a yellow pause icon for paused, a green checkmark for completed, a red cross for error).
- **Test 2.3 (Action Buttons/Menu Items):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running in the Kitty terminal with a Nerd Font. A menu or button bar is displayed.
    - **Action:** The menu/buttons include text labels with associated icons (e.g., ` Save`, ` Send`, ` Close`).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The icons are displayed next to their respective text labels, visually reinforcing the action.
