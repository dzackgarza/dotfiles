# Feature: Advanced Reasoning (v3.3)

## Overview

This phase focuses on enhancing the LLM REPL's reasoning capabilities through multi-agent collaboration, advanced cognitive modules, and sophisticated tool integration. This will allow the system to tackle more complex problems and exhibit more human-like problem-solving.

## Sub-Features and User Tests

### 1. Multi-Agent Collaboration

**Description:** Enables different specialized LLMs (agents) to work together, coordinate tasks, and hand off responsibilities to solve complex problems more effectively.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I can ask a question that requires expertise from multiple domains (e.g., code and literature), and the system should seamlessly coordinate different agents to provide a comprehensive answer.
- As a user, I should be able to understand which agents are involved in solving my query and how they are collaborating.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 1.1 (Code Analysis and Documentation Generation):**
    - **Action:** User asks: "Analyze the attached Python code for potential bugs and then generate comprehensive documentation for it, including examples."
    - **Expected Outcome:**
        1. A "Code Analysis Agent" (specialized LLM) identifies bugs and suggests fixes.
        2. A "Documentation Agent" (another specialized LLM) takes the analyzed code and generates documentation.
        3. The system presents a combined output, clearly indicating contributions from both agents.
- **Test 1.2 (Research and Synthesis):**
    - **Action:** User asks: "Research the latest advancements in quantum computing and summarize their implications for cybersecurity."
    - **Expected Outcome:**
        1. A "Research Agent" (specialized LLM) uses web search tools to gather information on quantum computing advancements.
        2. A "Cybersecurity Agent" (specialized LLM) analyzes the research findings specifically for cybersecurity implications.
        3. A "Synthesis Agent" (specialized LLM) combines the insights from both to provide a concise summary.

### 2. Enhanced Cognitive Modules

**Description:** Introduces advanced cognitive capabilities such as planning, memory, reflection, and learning to enable more sophisticated problem-solving and adaptation.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, the system should be able to break down complex tasks into manageable steps and execute them sequentially.
- As a user, the system should remember context from previous sessions and apply it to new queries.
- As a user, the system should be able to evaluate its own performance and learn from past interactions to improve.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 2.1 (Complex Task Planning):**
    - **Action:** User asks: "Write a full-stack web application that allows users to manage a to-do list, including a database, API, and frontend."
    - **Expected Outcome:** The system's "Planning Module" breaks this down into sub-tasks (e.g., database schema design, API endpoint creation, frontend UI development) and executes them in a logical sequence, potentially involving multiple tool calls and LLM interactions.
- **Test 2.2 (Persistent Memory Recall):**
    - **Action:** In Session A, user provides specific preferences (e.g., "I prefer Python for all coding tasks"). In Session B (new session), user asks for a coding task without specifying the language.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The system's "Memory Module" recalls the preference from Session A and defaults to Python for the coding task in Session B.
- **Test 2.3 (Self-Correction/Reflection):**
    - **Action:** User provides a task that the system initially struggles with or makes a suboptimal decision. User then provides feedback.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The system's "Reflection Module" analyzes the feedback and the previous interaction, and in a subsequent similar task, demonstrates improved performance or a different, more optimal approach.

### 3. Advanced Tool Integration

**Description:** Allows for custom tool development, chaining of tools, and enables the LLM to learn how to use new tools and optimize their usage.

**User Stories:**
- As a developer, I can easily create and integrate new custom tools into the system.
- As a user, the LLM should be able to combine multiple tools to achieve a complex outcome.
- As a user, the LLM should become more proficient at using tools over time.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 3.1 (Custom Tool Integration and Usage):**
    - **Action:** A developer integrates a new custom tool (e.g., a "Weather API" tool). User then asks: "What's the weather like in London?"
    - **Expected Outcome:** The LLM successfully identifies and uses the newly integrated "Weather API" tool to fetch and report the weather in London.
- **Test 3.2 (Tool Chaining/Composition):**
    - **Action:** User asks: "Find the latest news articles about AI, summarize the top 3, and then save them to a file named `ai_news.md`."
    - **Expected Outcome:** The LLM uses a "Web Search Tool" to find articles, a "Summarization Tool" to summarize them, and a "File Writing Tool" to save the output, demonstrating successful chaining of multiple tools.
- **Test 3.3 (Tool Learning/Optimization):**
    - **Action:** Over several interactions, a specific tool is used frequently, and the LLM initially uses it suboptimally. After some time, the LLM starts using the tool more efficiently (e.g., by providing more precise arguments or combining it with other tools more effectively).
    - **Expected Outcome:** Observable improvement in the LLM's efficiency or effectiveness in using that specific tool over time, without explicit programming changes.
