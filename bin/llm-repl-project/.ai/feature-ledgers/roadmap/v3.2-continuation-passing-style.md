# Feature: Continuation Passing Style (v3.2)

## Overview

This phase introduces the core innovation of the LLM REPL: the **LLM â†” Tool Continuous Conversation Loop**. This enables complex, multi-step reasoning tasks by allowing the LLM and local Python tools to engage in continuous conversation loops, facilitating reasoning-action-observation cycles.

## Sub-Features and User Tests

### 1. Conversation Loop Manager

**Description:** Manages the continuous interaction cycle between the LLM and tools, maintaining conversation context across iterations, handling loop termination, and preventing infinite loops.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I can ask a multi-step question that requires both LLM reasoning and tool execution, and the system should seamlessly manage the interaction.
- As a user, the system should prevent infinite loops during complex interactions and gracefully terminate if a loop is detected.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 1.1 (Multi-Step Analysis with Tool Use):**
    - **Action:** User asks: "Analyze the performance of `my_script.py`. First, list all Python files in the current directory, then read `my_script.py`, and finally, suggest performance improvements."
    - **Expected Outcome:**
        1. LLM identifies the need to list files, executes a file listing tool.
        2. Tool returns file list.
        3. LLM identifies `my_script.py`, executes a file reading tool.
        4. Tool returns content of `my_script.py`.
        5. LLM analyzes content and provides performance suggestions.
        6. The entire process flows smoothly without user intervention between steps.
- **Test 1.2 (Loop Prevention - Simple):**
    - **Action:** Provide a scenario where the LLM might get stuck in a simple loop (e.g., repeatedly asking for the same information that a tool cannot provide).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The Conversation Loop Manager detects the repetitive behavior and terminates the loop after a predefined number of iterations or a specific pattern, providing a message to the user.

### 2. Enhanced LLM Interface

**Description:** Provides streaming support for real-time feedback, manages context windows, integrates tool results into the conversation, and enables multi-turn reasoning capabilities.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I should see the LLM's thought process and tool interactions in real-time.
- As a user, the LLM should remember previous turns in the conversation and use that context for subsequent responses.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 2.1 (Streaming Feedback):**
    - **Action:** Ask a question that triggers a tool execution and subsequent LLM reasoning.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The LLM's responses and tool outputs are displayed incrementally, providing real-time feedback rather than waiting for the entire process to complete.
- **Test 2.2 (Context Window Management):**
    - **Action:** Engage in a long conversation involving multiple tool calls and LLM turns, then ask a question that relies on information from early in the conversation.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The LLM correctly recalls and utilizes the relevant context from previous turns to answer the question accurately.

### 3. Tool Result Integration

**Description:** Seamlessly integrates tool outputs into the LLM's context, formats structured results for LLM consumption, and handles error propagation.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, the LLM should understand and effectively use the output from tools to inform its next steps.
- As a user, if a tool returns an error, the LLM should acknowledge it and attempt to recover or inform me.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 3.1 (Structured Tool Output Integration):**
    - **Action:** Instruct the LLM to use a tool that returns structured data (e.g., a JSON response from an API call).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The LLM correctly parses and interprets the structured data, using it to formulate its next response or action.
- **Test 3.2 (Tool Error Handling by LLM):**
    - **Action:** Introduce a scenario where a tool execution consistently fails (e.g., an external API is down).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The LLM detects the repeated tool failure, informs the user about the issue, and potentially suggests alternative approaches or troubleshooting steps.
