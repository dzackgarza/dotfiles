# Feature: Timeline

This document describes the timeline feature, which is a central component of the application. The timeline provides a chronological view of the conversation and the AI's cognitive processes, and is designed to be a rich and interactive component.

## Goals

The primary goals of the timeline feature are to:

- Provide a clear and intuitive representation of the conversation history.
- Expose the AI's cognitive processes to the user, providing transparency and insight into how the AI is thinking.
- Support rich and interactive content, including LaTeX, dynamic token use animations, and timers.
- Allow for the dynamic transitioning of blocks between different states, such as "live" and "inscribed".

## Requirements

The timeline feature must meet the following requirements:

- It must be able to display a chronological list of messages and cognitive blocks.
- It must support the rendering of rich content, including LaTeX, Markdown, and code snippets.
- It must be able to display dynamic content, such as timers and token use animations.
- It must support the transitioning of blocks between different states, such as "live" and "inscribed".
- It must be implemented in a modular and extensible way, so that it can be easily customized and extended.

## Implementation Details

The timeline feature will be implemented using the `Textual` library, which provides a powerful and flexible framework for creating terminal-based user interfaces. The timeline will be implemented as a custom `Textual` widget, which will be responsible for rendering the timeline and handling user input.

The timeline will be composed of a set of blocks, which will be represented as custom `Textual` widgets. Each block will be responsible for rendering a specific type of content, such as a message, a cognitive block, or a timer.

The timeline will be updated in real-time, as new messages and cognitive blocks are added to the conversation. The timeline will also support the dynamic transitioning of blocks between different states, which will be implemented using `Textual`'s reactive properties and data binding features.

## Status

This feature is currently in the planning phase. The next steps are to:

1. Create a more detailed technical design for the timeline feature.
2. Implement a prototype of the timeline feature using the `Textual` library.
3. Integrate the timeline feature with the rest of the application.
