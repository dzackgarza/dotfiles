# Feature: Rich Content Display (using RichLog)

## Overview

This feature establishes `textual.widgets.RichLog` as the primary mechanism for displaying diverse content from plugins onto the application's "Sacred Timeline." It ensures that user input, AI cognition, tool output, and other system events can be rendered with rich formatting, including Markdown, syntax-highlighted code, tables, and panels, while maintaining an append-only, scrollable history.

## Sub-Features and User Tests

### 1. Core RichLog Integration and Appending

**Description:** The main timeline display will be implemented using `textual.widgets.RichLog`, allowing plugins to append various Rich renderable objects to it.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I expect to see a continuous stream of interactions and outputs displayed in a clear, scrollable area.
- As a developer, I can easily send any Rich renderable object to the timeline for display.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 1.1 (Appending Plain Text):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running.
    - **Action:** A plugin appends a simple string (e.g., "Hello, world!") to the timeline.
    - **Expected Outcome:** "Hello, world!" appears as a new line in the `RichLog` widget.
- **Test 1.2 (Appending Rich Text):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running.
    - **Action:** A plugin appends a `rich.text.Text` object with styling (e.g., `Text("Important message", style="bold red")`) to the timeline.
    - **Expected Outcome:** "Important message" appears in bold red text in the `RichLog` widget.
- **Test 1.3 (Automatic Scrolling):**
    - **Precondition:** The `RichLog` widget is full and new content is being appended.
    - **Action:** A series of new lines are appended to the `RichLog`.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The `RichLog` automatically scrolls to show the latest content, keeping the most recent interactions visible.

### 2. Markdown Rendering within RichLog

**Description:** Plugins will be able to send Markdown strings to the timeline, which `RichLog` will render as formatted Markdown using `rich.markdown.Markdown`.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I expect Markdown content (like AI responses or documentation) to be rendered with proper headings, lists, and emphasis.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 2.1 (Basic Markdown Rendering):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running.
    - **Action:** A plugin appends a Markdown string (e.g., `# Heading

- Item 1
- Item 2

**Bold** and *italic* text.`) to the timeline.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The Markdown is rendered with correct formatting (e.g., large heading, bullet points, bold and italic text).
- **Test 2.2 (Markdown with Code Blocks):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running.
    - **Action:** A plugin appends a Markdown string containing a fenced code block (e.g., ```python
print("Hello")
```) to the timeline.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The code block is rendered with syntax highlighting appropriate for Python.

### 3. Code Block Syntax Highlighting

**Description:** `RichLog` will correctly display code snippets with syntax highlighting, either embedded in Markdown or as standalone `rich.syntax.Syntax` objects.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I expect code snippets to be easy to read with proper syntax coloring.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 3.1 (Standalone Python Code):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running.
    - **Action:** A plugin appends a `rich.syntax.Syntax` object for Python code (e.g., `Syntax("def func():
    pass", "python")`) to the timeline.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The Python code is displayed with correct syntax highlighting.
- **Test 3.2 (Standalone Bash Code):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running.
    - **Action:** A plugin appends a `rich.syntax.Syntax` object for Bash code (e.g., `Syntax("ls -la
cd ..", "bash")`) to the timeline.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The Bash code is displayed with correct syntax highlighting.

### 4. Display of Structured Data (Tables, Panels)

**Description:** Plugins will be able to send structured data formatted as `rich.table.Table` or `rich.panel.Panel` objects to the timeline.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I expect structured information (like tool outputs or data summaries) to be presented in an organized and readable format.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 4.1 (Table Display):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running.
    - **Action:** A plugin appends a `rich.table.Table` object (e.g., a table with columns for Name, Age, City) to the timeline.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The table is rendered correctly with borders, headers, and aligned content.
- **Test 4.2 (Panel Display):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running.
    - **Action:** A plugin appends a `rich.panel.Panel` object (e.g., a panel containing a summary message) to the timeline.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The panel is rendered with its border and title, containing the specified content.

### 5. Dynamic Updates and Scrolling

**Description:** The `RichLog` widget will efficiently handle continuous appending of content, ensuring smooth scrolling and responsiveness.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, the timeline should remain responsive even when a large amount of content is being generated.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 5.1 (High Volume Appending):**
    - **Precondition:** The application is running.
    - **Action:** A plugin rapidly appends 1000 lines of text to the timeline.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The `RichLog` widget remains responsive, and new content appears without significant lag or UI freezing. Scrolling remains smooth.
- **Test 5.2 (User-Initiated Scrolling):**
    - **Precondition:** The `RichLog` widget contains more content than can fit on the screen.
    - **Action:** User attempts to scroll up and down using standard Textual scrolling mechanisms (e.g., mouse wheel, page up/down keys).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The `RichLog` scrolls smoothly, allowing the user to view past content.
