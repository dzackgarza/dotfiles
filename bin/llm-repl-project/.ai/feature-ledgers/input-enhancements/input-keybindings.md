# Feature: Zsh-like Keybindings for TextArea

## Overview

This feature ensures that the `textual.widgets.TextArea` input box provides a familiar and efficient text editing experience by leveraging its built-in keybindings and, if necessary, implementing custom ones to mimic common Zsh/readline-style shortcuts.

## Sub-Features and User Tests

### 1. Word Movement (Ctrl+Left / Ctrl+Right)

**Description:** `TextArea` natively supports moving the cursor word by word. This sub-feature verifies that this behavior aligns with Zsh expectations.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I can quickly navigate through my input line, jumping between words, using familiar key combinations.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 1.1 (Move Cursor Backward by Word - Ctrl+Left):**
    - **Precondition:** `TextArea` contains `this is a test` with cursor at the end.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+Left Arrow`.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Cursor moves to the beginning of `test`.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+Left Arrow` again.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Cursor moves to the beginning of `a`.
- **Test 1.2 (Move Cursor Forward by Word - Ctrl+Right):**
    - **Precondition:** `TextArea` contains `this is a test` with cursor at the beginning.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+Right Arrow`.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Cursor moves to the beginning of `is`.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+Right Arrow` again.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Cursor moves to the beginning of `a`.
- **Test 1.3 (Word Movement at Line Boundaries):**
    - **Precondition:** `TextArea` contains `word` with cursor at the beginning.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+Left Arrow`.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Cursor remains at the beginning of the line.
    - **Precondition:** `TextArea` contains `word` with cursor at the end.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+Right Arrow`.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Cursor remains at the end of the line.

### 2. Word Deletion (Ctrl+W)

**Description:** `TextArea` natively supports deleting the word preceding the cursor. This sub-feature verifies that this behavior aligns with Zsh expectations.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I can quickly delete entire words from my input, rather than character by character, using a familiar key combination.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 2.1 (Delete Previous Word):**
    - **Precondition:** `TextArea` contains `this is a test` with cursor at the end.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+W`.
    - **Expected Outcome:** `TextArea` becomes `this is a `.
- **Test 2.2 (Delete Multiple Words):**
    - **Precondition:** `TextArea` contains `one two three` with cursor at the end.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+W` three times.
    - **Expected Outcome:** `TextArea` becomes `` (empty).
- **Test 2.3 (Delete Word with Leading/Trailing Spaces):**
    - **Precondition:** `TextArea` contains `  word  ` with cursor at the end.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+W`.
    - **Expected Outcome:** `TextArea` becomes `  ` (deletes `word` and trailing spaces).
- **Test 2.4 (Delete Word at Beginning of Line):**
    - **Precondition:** `TextArea` contains `word` with cursor at the beginning.
    - **Action:** Press `Ctrl+W`.
    - **Expected Outcome:** `TextArea` remains `word` (or becomes empty if the definition includes deleting the current word if at the beginning).
