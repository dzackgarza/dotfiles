# Feature: Persistent Command History

## Overview

This feature implements a robust and persistent command history for the application's input box, allowing users to recall, navigate, and reuse previously executed commands across sessions. This history will serve as a data source for autocomplete and fuzzy search functionalities.

## Sub-Features and User Tests

### 1. Command Saving and Persistence

**Description:** All commands submitted by the user will be saved to a persistent storage (e.g., a SQLite database or a dedicated history file) and loaded automatically upon application startup.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I expect my command history to be available even after I close and reopen the application.
- As a user, I want to be able to review all my past commands.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 1.1 (Saving Commands Across Sessions):**
    - **Precondition:** The history is initially empty.
    - **Action:**
        1. Launch the application.
        2. Type and submit `ls -la`.
        3. Type and submit `git status`.
        4. Close the application.
        5. Relaunch the application.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The history is loaded, and `ls -la` and `git status` are available for recall (e.g., via up arrow or history search).
- **Test 1.2 (History File Integrity):**
    - **Precondition:** Commands have been saved to history.
    - **Action:** Inspect the underlying history storage file (e.g., `history.db` or `history.txt`).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The submitted commands are present and correctly formatted in the storage file.

### 2. History Navigation (Up/Down Arrows)

**Description:** Users can navigate through their command history using the Up and Down arrow keys within the input box.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I can quickly cycle through my previous commands using the arrow keys.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 2.1 (Basic Up/Down Navigation):**
    - **Precondition:** The history contains `command A`, `command B`, `command C` (in that order, `command C` being the most recent).
    - **Action:**
        1. Input box is empty.
        2. Press `Up Arrow`.
        3. Press `Up Arrow` again.
        4. Press `Down Arrow`.
    - **Expected Outcome:**
        1. Input box shows `command C`.
        2. Input box shows `command B`.
        3. Input box shows `command C`.
- **Test 2.2 (Navigating Beyond History Start):**
    - **Precondition:** The history contains `command A`, `command B`, `command C`.
    - **Action:** Press `Up Arrow` repeatedly until the beginning of history is reached.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The input box stops at `command A` and does not attempt to go further back.
- **Test 2.3 (Navigating Beyond History End):**
    - **Precondition:** The history contains `command A`, `command B`, `command C`. The input box currently shows `command A`.
    - **Action:** Press `Down Arrow` repeatedly until the end of history is reached.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The input box returns to an empty state (or the last command typed before navigation began, depending on exact desired behavior) and does not attempt to go further forward.

### 3. History Management (Optional: Clear/Limit)

**Description:** (Optional) Provide commands or settings to clear the history or limit its size to a certain number of entries.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to be able to clear my history for privacy or to start fresh.
- As a user, I want to prevent my history from growing indefinitely.

**End-to-End User Tests:**
- **Test 3.1 (Clear History Command):**
    - **Precondition:** The history contains several commands.
    - **Action:** Execute a `clear_history` command (e.g., `!clear_history`).
    - **Expected Outcome:** The history is emptied, and subsequent `Up Arrow` presses yield no commands.
- **Test 3.2 (History Size Limit):**
    - **Precondition:** The history size limit is set to 5. The history contains 5 commands.
    - **Action:** Submit a 6th command.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The oldest command is automatically removed from the history, maintaining the limit of 5 entries.
