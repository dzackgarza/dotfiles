# Wrinkl Rules

This document defines a set of rules and guidelines for using the `wrinkl` tool in this project. These rules are designed to ensure that the `wrinkl` tool is used safely and effectively, and to help developers to get the most out of its features.

## Core Principles

- **Safety First**: The safety and security of the project are of the utmost importance. When using the `wrinkl` tool, you should always prioritize safety and security, and should never take actions that could compromise the integrity of the codebase or the security of the application.
- **Respect Existing Conventions**: You should always respect the existing code patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions of the project. You should not use the `wrinkl` tool to make any changes that are inconsistent with the existing codebase, unless you have been explicitly instructed to do so.
- **Collaborate with Humans**: The `wrinkl` tool is designed to be a collaborative tool, and you should always be open to feedback and guidance from human developers. You should not use the `wrinkl` tool to make any major changes to the codebase without first consulting with a human developer.

## Guidelines for Using the `wrinkl` Tool

- **Read the Documentation**: Before using the `wrinkl` tool, you should read the relevant documentation in this directory to ensure that you understand the project's architecture, goals, and code patterns.
- **Analyze the Existing Code**: You should carefully analyze the existing code before using the `wrinkl` tool to make any changes. You should pay close attention to the surrounding code, tests, and configuration to ensure that your changes are consistent with the existing codebase.
- **Write Tests**: You should write tests for all new code that you add to the project using the `wrinkl` tool. You should also ensure that all existing tests pass before submitting your changes.
- **Run Linting and Type Checking**: You should run the project's linting and type-checking tools to ensure that your changes are consistent with the project's coding standards.
- **Provide Clear and Concise Explanations**: When submitting your changes, you should provide clear and concise explanations of the changes you have made. You should also explain why you have made these changes, and how they will benefit the project.
