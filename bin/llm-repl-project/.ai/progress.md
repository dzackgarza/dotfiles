# Progress: LLM REPL - Current Status and Milestones

## Current Status

We are actively working on **V3.1 Ledgers**, with a primary focus on establishing the critical architectural foundations for the LLM REPL. This involves proving the viability and robustness of the block-based UI and its core interactions, particularly the management of 'live' vs. 'inscribed' blocks, and explicitly addressing LLM context window limitations and interaction reliability using mocked data.

## What Works (Completed Milestones)

*   **Initial Memory Bank Structure**: The `.ai/` directory has been designated as the Memory Bank, and the initial core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been created and populated with high-level information.
*   **Core Vision Defined**: The overarching vision, core user experience pillars, and strategic priorities for the LLM REPL have been clearly articulated in `projectbrief.md`.
*   **Product Goals Outlined**: The problems the project solves and the desired user experience have been detailed in `productContext.md`.
*   **System Architecture Documented**: The immutable Sacred GUI Architecture, key technical decisions, and design patterns are now documented in `systemPatterns.md`.
*   **Technology Stack and Setup**: The primary technologies, development setup, and technical constraints are documented in `techContext.md`.

## What's Left to Build (Remaining V3.1 Priorities)

Based on the V3.1 Ledgers, the following are the high-priority items remaining:

1.  **`timeline.md` (Redesigned)**: Deep dive into live vs. inscribed blocks, context awareness, and transition mechanisms.
2.  **`memory-and-context-management.md` (Elevated)**: Strategies for dynamic context pruning, accurate token counting, and contextualization for LLM.
3.  **`streaming-live-output-system.md` (Elevated)**: Detailing how data is streamed and displayed for live blocks.
4.  **`event-driven-communication.md` (Elevated)**: Fundamental for communication between plugins/sub-modules and the UI.
5.  **`plugin-system.md` (Redesigned)**: Detailing plugin nesting and data aggregation.
6.  **`intelligent-router-system.md` (Elevated)**: Core component of the Cognition Block for routing user intent.
7.  **`rich-content-display-engine.md`**: For proper formatting and animation of blocks.
8.  **`testing-framework.md`**: Focus on testing live vs. inscribed block transitions, data transparency, and context management.
9.  **`llm-routing-and-cognitive-plugins.md`**: Implementation of LLM-based routing and cognitive plugins.
10. **`intelligent-context-pruning.md`**: Specific strategies for context pruning.
11. **`summarize-last-turns.md`**: Implementation of summarization techniques.

## Known Issues and Limitations

*   The agent's instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) have not yet been updated to fully reflect the new Memory Bank structure. This is a critical next step to ensure the agent correctly utilizes the new documentation.
*   Detailed content migration from existing `.ai` subdirectories into the new core Memory Bank files is still ongoing and requires careful review to ensure accuracy and conciseness.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The decision to blend the `.ai` directory structure with the Cline Memory Bank paradigm is a strategic shift to leverage existing documentation while gaining the benefits of persistent, structured context management for AI agents. This approach aims to create a more intelligent and self-aware development environment.
