# Task Master AI Integration Guide

## Overview

Task Master AI is an AI-driven development workflow tool that transforms how we manage software project tasks. It provides intelligent task generation, tracking, and implementation support through seamless integration with Claude Code and other AI development tools.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Task Generation
- Parse Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into actionable tasks
- AI-powered task breakdown and complexity analysis
- Research-driven task enhancement with current best practices
- Automatic dependency management and task prioritization

### 2. Dynamic Workflow Management
- Real-time task reorganization and restructuring
- Implementation drift handling - update future tasks based on current learnings
- Merge conflict resolution for team collaboration
- Flexible task hierarchy with unlimited nesting levels

### 3. AI-Enhanced Development
- Context-aware task suggestions and next-task recommendations
- Integration with multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, etc.)
- Research mode for staying current with latest development practices
- Automated progress tracking and documentation

## Project Integration Status

### Current Setup
- ✅ Task Master installed and initialized
- ✅ MCP configuration with API keys set up
- ✅ Models configured (Google Gemini main, OpenRouter fallback)
- ✅ PRD parsed and 10 initial tasks generated
- ✅ Claude Code integration active through CLAUDE.md

### Generated Task Structure
Our project now has 10 main tasks covering:
1. Project initialization with PDM
2. Sacred GUI layout implementation
3. SimpleBlockWidget with color coding
4. PromptInput widget development
5. Basic conversation flow
6. Persistent timeline storage
7. Turn lifecycle management
8. Auto-scroll and content sizing
9. Error boundary system
10. SubModuleWidget for cognition display

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Natural Language Workflow
Instead of running CLI commands directly, interact with Claude Code using natural language:

```
"What tasks are available to work on next?"
"Show me tasks 1, 3, and 5 to understand their status"
"Let's implement task 3. What does it involve?"
"Task 3 is complete. Please update its status."
```

The AI agent will automatically translate these to appropriate Task Master commands.

### 2. Implementation Drift Management
When implementation approaches change during development:

```
"We've decided to use MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL. Can you update all future tasks (from ID 4) to reflect this change?"
```

This triggers:
```bash
task-master update --from=4 --prompt="Update to use MongoDB, researching best practices" --research
```

### 3. Task Reorganization
For evolving project understanding:

```
"I think subtask 5.2 would fit better as part of task 7 instead. Can you move it there?"
```

Executes flexible task movement with automatic dependency updates.

### 4. Complexity-Driven Expansion
Break down complex tasks intelligently:

```
"Task 5 seems complex. Can you break it down with a focus on security considerations?"
```

Results in research-backed subtask generation with security best practices.

## Team Collaboration Patterns

### Merge Conflict Resolution
Task Master provides elegant solutions for team collaboration conflicts:

```
"I merged main and there's a conflict with tasks.json. My teammates created tasks 10-15 while I created tasks 10-12 on my branch."
```

The system helps preserve everyone's work while maintaining clean task structure.

### Parallel Development
Support for multiple development streams:
- Use git worktrees for parallel task development
- Each worktree can run independent Claude Code sessions
- Task Master maintains consistency across all contexts

## Advanced Features

### Research Integration
Task Master can research current best practices and integrate findings:
- `--research` flag enables AI research for any operation
- Perplexity integration for up-to-date technical information
- Automatic incorporation of research findings into task details

### Complexity Analysis
Built-in complexity scoring and expansion recommendations:
- Analyze task complexity across the entire project
- Get recommendations for optimal subtask breakdown
- Identify tasks that need more granular planning

### Interactive Task Management
Multi-task operations with batch actions:
- View multiple tasks simultaneously
- Perform group operations (mark multiple as in-progress)
- Interactive action menus for efficient workflow

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Sacred GUI Development
Task Master is perfectly aligned with our Sacred GUI architecture:
- Tasks 2-3 cover the core Sacred Timeline and block system
- Task 4 handles the PromptInput widget
- Tasks 5-7 manage the conversation flow and lifecycle
- Tasks 8-10 add polish and advanced features

### Textual Framework Integration
All tasks are designed with Textual best practices:
- Widget-based architecture patterns
- CSS-in-Python styling approaches
- Event-driven communication systems
- Testing strategies specific to Textual applications

## Best Practices for Our Project

### 1. Task Logging
Use `task-master update-subtask` to log implementation details:
```bash
task-master update-subtask --id=3.1 --prompt="Implemented color coding using Textual's color system. Used Rich console markup for dynamic styling."
```

### 2. Research-Driven Development
For complex widgets or patterns, use research mode:
```bash
task-master expand --id=5 --research --prompt="Focus on Textual best practices for async event handling"
```

### 3. Progress Tracking
Regular status updates maintain project momentum:
```bash
task-master set-status --id=2 --status=done
task-master next  # Get next available task
```

### 4. Implementation Context
Log learnings that affect future tasks:
```bash
task-master update --from=6 --prompt="We discovered Textual's built-in persistence utilities. Update storage-related tasks to use these instead of custom solutions."
```

## CLI Command Reference

### Essential Daily Commands
```bash
# Get next task to work on
task-master next

# View specific task details
task-master show 3

# Update implementation notes
task-master update-subtask --id=3.1 --prompt="implementation details"

# Mark task complete
task-master set-status --id=3 --status=done

# View all tasks
task-master list
```

### Analysis and Planning
```bash
# Analyze complexity
task-master analyze-complexity --research

# Expand complex tasks
task-master expand --id=5 --research

# Update multiple future tasks
task-master update --from=6 --prompt="changes based on current implementation"
```

### Organization and Maintenance
```bash
# Move tasks around
task-master move --from=5.2 --to=7.3

# Validate dependencies
task-master validate-dependencies

# Generate task files
task-master generate
```

## Integration with Sacred Timeline

Task Master's workflow aligns perfectly with our Sacred Timeline concept:
- **User Input**: Natural language task requests
- **AI Cognition**: Task Master's AI analysis and planning
- **Assistant Response**: Concrete implementation tasks and guidance

The tool becomes part of the Sacred Timeline itself, creating a meta-layer of project management that follows the same interaction patterns we're building into the application.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Integrations
- Direct Sacred GUI integration for visual task management
- Timeline-based task visualization within the application
- Real-time collaboration features for team development
- Integration with existing .ai ledger system

### Research Areas
- Automated testing integration with task completion
- AI-driven code review as part of task verification
- Context-aware documentation generation from task progress
- Integration with git workflows and PR creation

## Conclusion

Task Master AI transforms our development workflow from linear task execution to dynamic, AI-enhanced project evolution. It provides the intelligent scaffolding needed to manage complex projects while maintaining flexibility for changing requirements and emerging insights.

The integration creates a development environment where:
- Tasks evolve based on implementation learnings
- AI provides contextual guidance and research
- Team collaboration is seamless and conflict-free
- Progress is automatically tracked and documented

This foundation enables us to focus on creative problem-solving while the AI handles project management complexity.
