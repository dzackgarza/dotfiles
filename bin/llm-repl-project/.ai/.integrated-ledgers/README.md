# Integrated Ledgers Archive

This directory contains ledgers that have been successfully integrated into the Task Master AI system via PRD parsing. These ledgers have been "retired" from active development as their requirements have been translated into actionable tasks.

## Integration Status

### V3.1 - Critical Architectural Foundations âœ… INTEGRATED
**Integration Date**: 2025-07-13  
**PRD**: `.taskmaster/docs/v3.1-foundations-prd.md`  
**Tasks Generated**: 15 tasks (IDs 11-25)  
**Status**: All 15 V3.1 foundation tasks successfully parsed and added to Task Master

**Integrated Features**:
- Sacred Timeline Core (live vs inscribed blocks)
- Context Management (dynamic pruning, token counting)
- Streaming Live Output (real-time transparency)
- Event-Driven Communication (decoupled plugin-UI)
- Plugin System Foundation (nesting, MCP integration)
- Intelligent Router System (intent routing, multi-LLM)
- Rich Content Display Engine (Markdown, LaTeX, code)
- Testing Framework (comprehensive validation)
- LLM Routing & Cognitive Plugins (core cognition)
- Intelligent Context Pruning (advanced context management)
- Turn Summarization System (conversation length management)
- Sacred Timeline Persistence (complete history preservation)
- Graceful Rate Limit Handling (robust LLM integration)
- Long-Running Work Ledger (cross-session tracking)
- Manual Context Re-injection (user-controlled context)

### V3.2 - Continuation Passing Style ðŸŸ¡ PENDING
**Status**: Not yet integrated  
**Location**: Still in `.ai/ledgers/v3.2/`

### V3.3 - Advanced Reasoning ðŸŸ¡ PENDING
**Status**: Not yet integrated  
**Location**: Still in `.ai/ledgers/v3.3/`

### V4.x - Production & Intelligence Framework ðŸŸ¡ PENDING
**Status**: Not yet integrated  
**Location**: Still in `.ai/ledgers/v4.*/`

## Integration Workflow

1. **Analysis**: Review ledger for completeness and priority
2. **PRD Creation**: Create comprehensive PRD in `.taskmaster/docs/`
3. **Parsing**: Use `task-master parse-prd --append` to generate tasks
4. **Validation**: Verify tasks match ledger requirements
5. **Retirement**: Move integrated ledgers to `.ai/.integrated-ledgers/`
6. **Documentation**: Update this README with integration status

## Task Master Integration Benefits

- **Preserved Priorities**: All ledger priorities maintained in tasks
- **Natural Language Workflow**: Tasks work with Claude Code's conversational interface
- **Research Enhancement**: Complex tasks can use `--research` mode for current best practices
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Tasks can be updated based on implementation learnings
- **Dependency Management**: Proper task dependencies ensure correct implementation order

## Accessing Integrated Ledgers

Integrated ledgers are preserved in this archive for reference but should not be actively modified. All development work should happen through the Task Master system:

- View tasks: `task-master list`
- Get next task: `task-master next`
- Update tasks: `task-master update-task --id=X --prompt="changes"`
- Research mode: `task-master expand --id=X --research`

## Future Integration

When ready to integrate additional versions:

1. Create PRD for the next version (e.g., V3.2)
2. Parse with `task-master parse-prd --append`
3. Move integrated ledgers to appropriate version folder here
4. Update this README with new integration status

This process ensures a clean transition from specification-driven (ledgers) to execution-driven (Task Master) development while preserving all historical context.
