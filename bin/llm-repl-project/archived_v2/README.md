# Archived V2 Block Architecture

This directory contains the archived V2 block architecture that was replaced by the V3 plugin architecture.

## Files Archived
- `main_v2.py` - Original main.py using V2 block system
- `scrivener_v2.py` - V2 Scrivener for block management
- `blocks/` - V2 block implementations (incomplete)

## Why Archived
The V2 block architecture had several issues:
1. **Split states** - Blocks could have inconsistent display states
2. **Incomplete implementations** - SystemCheckBlock rendered empty content
3. **Tight coupling** - Blocks were not truly independent
4. **Limited extensibility** - Adding new block types required core modifications

## V3 Plugin Architecture Benefits
1. **Independent plugins** - Each plugin is self-contained
2. **Unified display system** - Standardized timing and token tracking
3. **Complete implementations** - All plugins render proper content
4. **Cognitive modules** - Advanced processing capabilities
5. **Comprehensive testing** - 88% test coverage with adversarial tests

## Migration Complete
- Old `src/main.py` → `archived_v2/main_v2.py`
- Old `src/scrivener_v2.py` → `archived_v2/scrivener_v2.py`
- Old `src/blocks/` → `archived_v2/blocks/`
- New `src/main.py` uses V3 plugin architecture
- Justfile updated to use new architecture

The V3 plugin architecture resolves all the issues identified in V2, including the "System Check is empty" problem that was caused by incomplete V2 implementations.
