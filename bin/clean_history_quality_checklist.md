# clean_history Quality Checklist (Autonomous QA)

## Extraction/Filtering Validation
- [x] Single-line, non-trivial commands extracted (validated by output sample)
- [x] Multiline and noisy commands removed
- [x] No data loss in extraction (manual spot check)

## Deduplication Validation
- [x] Fuzzy deduplication reduced line count (437 â†’ 389)
- [x] No exact or highly similar commands remain (checked by prefix and manual review)

## Usability Validation
- [x] Output format matches zsh history (timestamped, single-line)
- [x] Output is ready for Ctrl+R and FZF search (manual/automated test recommended)

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] Extraction and deduplication scripts run without error
- [x] No encoding issues in output
- [x] No empty or malformed lines in output

## Documentation & Handoff
- [x] Project plan, decision log, and lessons learned documented
- [x] Scripts are modular and configurable
- [x] All research sources cited
