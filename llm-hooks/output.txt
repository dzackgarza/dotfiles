This is a hook script that runs after Claude finishes responding. It:

1. Sends a desktop notification "Claude Done"
2. Blocks execution (exit code 2) with detailed instructions for Claude to continue thesis revisions in `/home/dzack/diss/000-write`
3. The blocking message includes strict mathematical writing guidelines and workflow instructions

The `BLOCK = True` flag controls whether it blocks or allows continuation.
